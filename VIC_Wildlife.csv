Balaenoptera musculus,Blue Whale,Endangered,36,Animalia,Mammalia,http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=36,Balaenopteridae,Balaenoptera,musculus,"Both the Antarctic blue whale and pygmy blue whale have common phenotypic traits such as grey skin with mottled patterns, which enables identification of individuals. When submerged, the blue whale appears to be a luminous pale blue or aqua. They have a pronounced 'splashguard' in front of their blowholes, with a single pronounced longitudinal ridge leading forward on the rostrum. Their blow is tall and powerful (approximately 10 m). They have a long, smooth back with a small, variably-shaped dorsal fin set towards the tail (Jefferson et al. 1993). Differences between the two subspecies were first determined by whaling catches in the austral summer feeding season (Attard et al. 2010).Differences between the pygmy blue whale and the Antarctic blue whale include:<ul><li><strong>Morphology</strong>: the Antarctic blue whale is the largest of the two subspecies growing to maximum lengths of over 30 m; in comparison, the pygmy blue whale is recorded growing to 24.1 m (Branch et al. 2009, Attard et al. 2010). Despite this difference, determining subspecies in the field can be difficult (Branch et al. 2009)</li><li><strong>Vocalisations/acoustic calls</strong>: both subspecies produce distinctive acoustic calls that can be used to identify each species as well as provide insight into geographic and seasonal distributions (Stafford et al. 2004, 2011).</li><li><strong>Genetics</strong>: both subspecies are genetically distinct, however diagnostic genetic markers are not available (LeDuc et al. 2007, Attard et al. 2012). The Antarctic and pygmy blue whale have been known to hybridise (Attard et al. 2012).</li><li><strong>Austral summer distribution</strong>: the pygmy blue whale is typically found in more northern areas (north of 54&deg; S) at lower latitudes, throughout the Indian Ocean, whereas the Antarctic blue whale is usually found further south of Australia (60&deg; S), circumpolar wide (Branch et al. 2009, Attard et al. 2010).</li></ul>Blue whale and fin whale hybrids has been documented in five cases (B&eacute;rub&eacute; & Aguilar 1998; Cipriano & Palumbi 1999; Spilliaert et al. 1991). The hybrids - three females and two males - were taken in commercial whaling operations in the Northern Hemisphere.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Anim1754_-_Flickr_-_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg/1600px-Anim1754_-_Flickr_-_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg,NOAA Photo Library,"Blue whale habitat is variable between the two subspecies found in Australian waters. The Antarctic blue whale tends to remain at higher latitudes and migrate to lower latitudes for feeding, breeding and calving during the Australian summer, whilst some remain within the Antarctic waters year-round (Branch 2007, ÃÂÃÂ irovic et al. 2009). In comparison, the pygmy blue whale habitat is more diverse, expanding throughout the Indian Ocean, with individuals moving between Australia and the warmer waters of Indonesia (Branch et al. 2007, Double et al. 2014).","Blue whale sightings in Australian waters are widespread, and it is likely that the whales occur around the continent at various times of the year. However, much of the Australian continental shelf and coastal waters have no particular significance to the whales and are used only for migration and opportunistic feeding. The only known areas of significance to the blue whale are feeding areas around the southern continental shelf, notably the Perth Canyon, in Western Australia, and the Bonney Upwelling and adjacent upwelling areas of South Australia and Victoria (DEH 2005).",141.855,-38.2626
Eubalaena australis,Southern Right Whale,Endangered,40,Animalia,Mammalia,http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=40,Balaenidae,Eubalaena,australis,"The southern right whale is a large baleen whale with a less streamlined shape than balaenopterids like the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). They grow to a maximum length of 17.5 m and weight of 80 t, with mature females often slightly larger than males (Bannister et al. 1996). The mean length of sexually mature females off the South African coast was calculated as 13.85 m (Best & Ruther 1992) and off Argentina as 13.66 m (Whitehead & Payne 1981). Mature females in Soviet catches from the Southern Ocean averaged 14.34 m (Tormosov et al. 1998). Southern Right Whales are about 5.5 m long and 1000-1500 kg at birth and physical maturity is reached at a length of 16 m (Bannister et al. 1996). Age at physical maturity is unknown (Bannister et al. 1996). The vast majority of southern right whale individuals are uniformly black in colour, often with a white ventral blaze of varying size and shape centred on the umbilicus. About 2.8 % of adults are mottled dark brown to grey, having been white with varying degrees of black marking at birth (Bannister 1990). A small number of adults (1.4-3.4 %) have white dorsal blazing (Bannister 1990). The pectoral fins are short and paddle like, the flukes are uniform in colour with smooth trailing edges, and there is no dorsal fin. A distinctive feature is the presence of whitish or yellowish callosities on the rostrum, chin and lower jaw. These are formed as roughened patches of keratinised skin and colonised by cyamids (small crustaceans known as 'whale lice') (Cummings 1985a). Callosity patterns are present at birth and persist with minor variation through life, such that individual southern right whales can be identified by the number and configuration of callosities (Payne et al. 1983). They provide the basis for studies relying on an ability to recognise individuals from natural markings over long time frames (Best 1990e; Burnell & Bryden 1997; Payne 1986). The southern right whale head is large compared to body size and the jaw line strongly arched (Jefferson et al. 1993). Baleen plates number from 205-270 and the baleen is usually, dark, very fine, and long (maximum 2.2 m) in comparison to other species (Cummings 1985a). Blubber thickness has been recorded from Soviet catch data as 14-17 cm for a 10 m whale and 23-24 cm for a 15 m whale (Tormosov et al. 1998).",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Southern_right_whale6.jpg,MichaÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂl CATANZARITI,"Feeding Habitat: The feeding habitat of the southern right whale is very poorly known and there have been no dedicated studies in feeding areas. Based on sightings information, most feeding areas are thought to be in deeper offshore waters ranging from sub-Antarctic areas to locations south of 60ÃÂ¡ S (Bannister et al. 1997, 1999; Goodall & Galeazzi 1986; Ohsumi & Kasamatsu 1986; Tormosov et al. 1998) in areas probably associated with climatic and environmental conditions generating high productivity. A single coastal feeding area has been identified off the west coast of Africa where upwelling and thermocline development is apparent, and oceanographic conditions are thought to provide suitable feeding conditions (Best et al. 2002). Breeding Habitat: Differential use of habitat by calving and non-calving whales has been noted off Australia (Burnell & Bryden 1997), South Africa (Best 1981) and Argentina (Payne 1986), perhaps implying habitat selection within calving grounds. The southern right whale prefers near-shore, shallow water depths and being in close proximity to other individuals whilst on calving grounds in Australian waters (Pirzl 2008). In breeding areas, non-calving whales are highly social whilst calving whales remain apart from robust socialising groups (Pirzl 2008). Habitat selection and habitat use on Australian calving grounds is influenced by breeding status and/or the type of calving ground, in addition to other environmental factors such as swell height (Pirzl 2008). The southern right whale is constrained in their ability to colonise unused areas of potentially suitable habitat due to a high degree of site fidelity (individuals returning to the same breeding site each year). This combined with previous exploitation history suggesting extirpation of migratory traditions to these sites (Carroll et al. 2015; Pirzl 2008).",The southern right whale is seasonally present along the Australian coast between late April and early November. It has been recorded in the coastal waters of all Australian states with the exception of the Northern Territory (Bannister et al. 1996).,142.5208,-38.4042

A ring of dark hairs may be present around the eye. The length of individuals, including the tail, is between 180-250 mm. The tail is narrow, flexible, sparsely furred, and white to pale pinkish grey underneath with a narrow dark strip along its upper surface and up to 145 mm in length. The ears are 18-22 mm long and the hind feet 25-29 mm long. Adult weight varies widely between 25-86 g (Edwards 2009; Ford 2008; NSW OEH 2012; Menkhorst 2003).Animals from the Grampians and Otway Range in western Victoria tend to be larger and darker than those from east of Melbourne (Menkhorst & Knight 2001; Menkhorst & Seebeck unpub. data cited in Menkhorst 2003) and NSW (ACT TAMS 1999a).",https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/ImageHandler.ashx?graphicsId=45733&maxWidth=150,Jackie Miles and Linda Broome,"The Konoom occurs in a wide variety of habitats, from heath to dry sclerophyll forest, especially along ridgetops with a heath understorey, and occasionally adjacent wetter habitats such as fern gullies.

Ground cover is often dense and low, such as occurs in heaths, or grass tussocks, rocks and logs in more open habitats that provides shelter sites. Soil conditions also need to be conducive to burrowing and growth of hypogeal fungi, a major component of the diet (Menkhorst & Broome 2008a; Menkhorst 2003).

It is silent except for a low  kiss kiss sound made between mothers and young, or when under stress (NSW NPWS 1999).",https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/ImageHandler.ashx?graphicsId=22657&maxWidth=150,Viridans,"The habitat of the Long-footed Potoroo includes temperate rainforest, riparian forest and wet sclerophyll forest (Nunan et al. 2000). It occurs at a range of elevations from around 100 m (East Gippsland) to greater than 1200 m (the Victorian Alps). The species occurs in vegetation communities with constantly moist soil. Within its range in NSW, such vegetation is restricted mainly to riparian (riverside) areas (NSW NPWS 2002b). Trees in these communities include Lilly Pilly (Acmena smithii), Messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua), Mountain Grey Gum (Eucalyptus cypellocarpa), Brown Barrel (Eucalyptus fastigata) and Blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon). Understorey plants include Forest Wire-grass (Tetrarrhena juncea), Red-fruit Saw-sedge (Gahnia sieberiana), other sedges Carex and Cyperus spp., and ferns. In Victoria it always occurs in or near (usually within 250 m of) damp forest types (Jones 1998; Jones & Johnson 1997).The species needs dense cover to provide shelter and protection from predators. During the day, the Long-footed Potoroo nests beneath ferns, grass or sedge tussocks, or fallen timber (Jones & Johnson 1997; Lewis & Thulin 1995; Triggs 1998). One nest was made of bracken and coarse grass, lined with fine grass and Long-footed Potoroo hair (Jones & Johnson 1997). The species appears to prefer a sheltered aspect, a mixed species overstorey and a dense understorey for both resting and foraging (Nunan et al. 2000). One study, based on trapping records, found that Long-footed Potoroos use cool moist gullies more often during drier times of the year (spring and summer), avoiding drier ridges and slopes (Scotts & Seebeck 1989). A later study using trapping and radio-tracking in the same area found that they use both gullies and slopes, and more captures were on upper slopes, perhaps because they used more of the open vegetation after introduced predators were controlled (Green et al. 1998).","The Long-footed Potoroo occurs in Victoria and NSW in the following locations:Populations of the Long-footed Potoroo in Victoria    <ul>  East Gippsland, north-east of Orbost, in the catchments of the Brodribb River, Bemm River, Rodger River and Yalmy River. This population is bounded by the Rodger River, Mount Ellery, the McKenzie River, and Pinnak Road. Based on part of a skull found in a predator scat, there may be a separate population around 45 km further east near Mount Drummer, east of the Cann River (Claridge 2002; NSW NPWS 2002b; VDSE 2003).     .  The Alpine National Park region of north-eastern Victoria, between Mt Feathertop and Mt Buller, concentrated in the region bounded by Mt Sarah, Mt Selwyn, the Cobbler Plateau, Mt Speculation, Mt Howitt and Mt Darling, in the West Buffalo, East Riley and Tea Tree Range areas of the Barry Mountains. This population is 170 km west of the closest known record from East Gippsland (Jones 1998; Jones & Johnson 1997).

A black stripe runs the length of the body, and white cheek stripes are present on both sides of the head. A horny 'nail' occurs at the tip of the tail, is between 3-6mm and is partly concealed by hair (Evans 1992 cited in Lundie-Jenkins 2001).The species has a high level of sexual dimorphism and males may be up to twice as large as females (Sigg & Goldizen 2006).",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Bridled_nailtail_wallaby-female-01.JPG/1024px-Bridled_nailtail_wallaby-female-01.JPG,DiverDave,"Current Distribution: The Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby occurs in woodland, particularly in Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) scrub, preferring areas with the most fertile soil (Lundie-Jenkins 2001). During the day (when they are resting), Bridled Nail-tail Wallabies prefer habitat that consists of young Brigalow regrowth or contains fallen logs (Evans 1996). They shelter beneath shrubs, in large grass tussocks, and inside hollow logs. Adults prefer logs where available (Fisher & Goldizen 2001) but also used grass shelters as the biomass of grass increases after a drought, enabling them to shelter closer to feeding areas. They generally choose shelter sites with the densest cover of foliage and stems at Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby height (25-50 cm), and this type of shelter is concentrated at the edges of wooded areas such as Brigalow regrowth (Fisher 2000). At night (when they are feeding), they prefer the ecotone habitat containing both pasture and young Brigalow regrowth (Evans 1996). When feeding in open pasture, they prefer to stay close to the edge of shelter habitat (Evans 1996).

When feeding in open pasture, they prefer to stay close to the edge of shelter habitat (Evans 1996). On the north western section of Taunton National Park (Scientific), the Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby is found in all four of the major vegetation types; open grassy eucalypt woodland dominated by Poplar Box (Eucalyptus populnea), dense Acacia forest dominated by Brigalow, transitional vegetation intermediate between the woodland and forest, and in areas of very dense Brigalow regrowth (Tierney 1985). After clearing, Brigalow grows back from root stock, forming dense thickets. Older Brigalow regrowth has sparse foliage in the 0-1 m height range, but has a closed canopy above this height. Younger regrowth forms patches of small dense bushes, obscuring visibility below 1 m. At Idalia National Park, reintroduced Bridled Nail-tail Wallabies use open woodland as well as Brigalow regrowth, and also use Wilga bushes (Geijera parviflora) as shelter habitat (Veldman 1998 cited in Pople et al. 2001). Bridled Nail-tail Wallabies prefer vegetation edges: in the mid 1980s, they were most likely to occur in a narrow band of vegetation at the interface between dense Acacia scrub and open grassy eucalypt woodland in the north west of the Park (Tierney 1985). In the mid 1990s when the Brigalow regrowth in the north east of the Park had reached 2-3 m in height, they preferred the area where Brigalow regrowth abuts pasture there, and the area where rosewood (Acacia rhodoxylon) and Eucalypt woodland borders open alluvial flats in the centre of the Park. In both areas, the feeding ranges of many wallabies are concentrated at former cattle yards, where food is plentiful due to the fertile soil (Fisher 2000).","TheÃÂ Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby is confined to Taunton National Park (Scientific) (an area of 11 000 ha) near the town of Dingo with some sightings within 10 km of the park (Davidson 1991; Lundie-Jenkins 2001). Population genetics and radio-tracking studies have shown that the populations at different localities within Taunton National Park (Scientific) are not isolated, but connected through frequent juvenile dispersal (Fisher 1999a). One reintroduced population is confined to a smaller section of Idalia National Park in Western Queensland (Pople et al. 2001), and another exists at Avocet Nature Refuge near Emerald, in Central Queensland (Lundie-Jenkins & Lowry 2005). Another population has been re-introducedÃÂ at Scotia Sanctuary (64 000 ha), 150 km south of Broken Hill (Finlayson et al. 2008).There was a captive population of the Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby at Pallarenda near Townsville between 1991 and 2004. There is currently a captive population at David Fleay Wildlife Park in Queensland (Johnson 1997; Lundie-Jenkins & Lowry 2005), and at Western Plains Zoo, Taronga Zoo, Scotia Sanctuary, and Genaren Hill Sanctuary in New South Wales (Lundie-Jenkins 2001; Lundie-Jenkins & Lowry 2005).At the time of European settlement, Bridled Nail-tail Wallabies were abundant in eastern Australia to the west of the Great Dividing Range. Reports by naturalists Gilbert (reported in Gould 1863), Gould (1863)and Collet (1887 cited in Gordon and Lawrie 1980) indicate that in the mid-nineteenth century, the species ranged from the Murray River region of north-western Victoria (possibly into eastern South Australia), through central New South Wales, and north to Charters Towers in Queensland (Evans & Gordon 1995). The species' range declined dramatically around 1900, and there were no confirmed sightings reported during the period 1937-1973 (Lundie-Jenkins 2001). However, the Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby was said to occur 50 km outside Tambo (in central Queensland) in a letter to David Fleay by J.K.

Hatchlings enter the open ocean and begin feeding on small animals. Small Loggerhead Turtles live at or near the surface of the ocean and move with the ocean currents. In eastern Australia, there is evidence that they spend around 15 years or more in the open ocean (M. Chaloupka pers. comm. cited in Bjorndal et al. 2000), with much of their feeding in the top 5 m of water (Spotila 2004), before recruiting to their chosen inshore or neritic feeding area. Loggerhead Turtles choose a wide variety of tidal and sub-tidal habitat as feeding areas (Limpus 2008a). Loggerhead Turtles show fidelity to both their foraging and breeding areas (Limpus 2008a). When ready for breeding, mature turtles migrate to their chosen breeding area. Nesting females stay within an ""internesting area"" during their nesting period. Once breeding and nesting is complete, turtles return to their favoured foraging areas.","In Australia, the Loggerhead Turtle occurs in the waters of coral and rocky reefs, seagrass beds and muddy bays throughout eastern, northern and western Australia (Limpus 1995a; Limpus et al. 1992; Prince 1994b). While nesting is concentrated in southern Queensland and from Shark Bay to the North West Cape in Western Australia, foraging areas are more widely distributed. Females tagged at the south-east Queensland nesting areas have been recorded in waters off Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, Northern Territory, Queensland and NSW (Limpus 2008a). The Western Australian stock forage from Shark Bay, Western Australia through to Arnhem Land, Gove and into the Java Sea of Indonesia (Baldwin et al. 2003; Prince 1998 cited in Limpus 2008a). The eastern and western Australian stocks are probably sharing feeding areas off Arnhem Land (Limpus 2008a) though no interbreeding of these two stocks is evident.",147.7,-37.9

Both males and females have a spindled shaped body with unscaled keeled carapaces (shells) (Marquez 1990). Adults are black with pale spots. These spots turn pinkish when out of the water as blood flows to the surface of the skin to cool the body (Spotila et al. 1996).Leatherback Turtles have a number of physiological adaptions that allow them to maintain elevated body temperatures in cold water and avoid overheating in warmer water, including low metabolic rate, large thermal inertia, blood flow adjustments and peripheral insulation (Paladino et al. 1990, Southwood et al. 2005, Wallace et al. 2005, cited in Houghton et al. 2008).",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Leatherback_sea_turtle_Tinglar%2C_USVI_%285839996547%29.jpg/440px-Leatherback_sea_turtle_Tinglar%2C_USVI_%285839996547%29.jpg,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Southeast Region,"The Leatherback Turtles is a highly pelagic species, venturing close to shore mainly during the nesting season (Sarti Martinez 2000). Houghton and colleagues (2008) tracked deep (300ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ1250 m) and protracted dives (> 1 hour) by Leatherback Turtles in the North Atlantic. It is known from waters all around Australia (Robins et al. 2002) and can be found foraging year round in Australian waters (Limpus in Hamann et al. 2006) over Australian continental shelf waters. Adults feed mainly on pelagic soft-bodied creatures such as jellyfish and tunicates (Bone 1998; Cogger 1992), which occur in greatest concentrations at the surface in areas of upwelling or convergence. The regular appearance of Leatherback Turtles in cool temperate waters is probably due to the seasonal occurrence of large numbers of jellyfish. Leatherback Turtles require sandy beaches to nest, with some evidence that coarser sand is more conducive to successful hatching than finer sand (Limpus et al. 1984). Sand temperatures between 24ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ34 ÃÂ¡C are needed for successful incubation (Limpus et al. 1984). Beaches free from light pollution are required to prevent disorientation, disturbance and to allow nesting females to come ashore.","The Leatherback Turtle is a pelagic feeder, found in tropical, subtropical and temperate waters throughout the world (Marquez 1990). Large body size, high metabolism, a thick adipose tissue layer and regulation of blood flow (Spotila et al.1997) allow them to utilise cold water foraging areas unlike other sea turtle species. For this reason this species is regularly found in the high latitudes of all oceans including the South Pacific Ocean in the waters offshore from NSW, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia (Benson et al. 2011; Limpus & MacLachlan 1979, 1994). It has been recorded feeding in the coastal waters of all Australian States (Hamann et al. 2006).",146.059,-38.811

Adults grow to about 40 mm (males) to 55 mm (females). Their body colour may be dull grey, olive or reddish brown, and may be uniform or consist of indistinct black markings and salmon-coloured flecks. The abdomen is white. The backs of the thighs are dark brown, with a few small pale spots. The dorsum usually has a slightly warty appearance, while the ventral surface is pale and finely granular. The throat is smooth and white in females and dark in males. A faint, thin, black strip begins at the snout and passes through the eye, curving slightly over the small tympanum to the shoulder. The back of the thighs may be dark brown or covered in a yellow and black reticulated pattern. The fingers and toes have well developed discs, but of moderate size, and the toes are strongly, nearly fully webbed while the fingers are web-free. Webbing extends to the base of all discs except the second toe. The vomerine teeth (on roof of mouth) extend from between to behind the choanae (opening in roof of skull forming one end of nasal passage), and there are also small maxillary teeth (Barker et al. 1995; Moore 1961).Males lack a distinct vocal sac and the call has been described as a purring 'qirk qirk qirk' lasting two or three seconds (Barker et al. 1995; Moore 1961; Robinson 1993) or a &lsquo;craww craww craww craww&rsquo; (Smith & Hunter 2003).The tadpole of the Booroolong Frog is free swimming (Anstis et al. 1998). The body is elongate and flattened, with a rounded snout, and well developed tail musculature. Individuals attain a total length of 50 mm prior to metamorphosis. The eyes are dorso-lateral and the mouth is ventral. Dorsal body colour is uniform rusty-brown with some darker mottling, which continues along the tail muscle. A conspicuous dark brown band is present across the lower back region. The under surface has an almost uniform gold sheen, with some darker patches. The oral disc is large, and a band of oral papillae surround the entire margin. There are two rows of anterior labial teeth, and three posterior rows (Anstis et al. 1998).",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Litoria_booroolongensis.jpg/440px-Litoria_booroolongensis.jpg,Tnarg,"The Booroolong Frog occurs along permanent streams with some fringing vegetation cover such as ferns, sedges or grasses (Anstis 2002; Robinson 1993). Adults occur on or near cobble banks and other rock structures within stream margins, or near slow-flowing connected or isolated pools that contain suitable rock habitats (NSW OEH 2011b). Streams range from small slow-flowing creeks to large rivers (The Victorian Frog Group 1999) in dissected mountainous country, tablelands, foothills and lowland plains (Anstis et al. 1998; Gillespie 1999). The species is associated with the following vegetation associations (NSW DECC 2005ap):","Present range: The Booroolong Frog is restricted to tablelands and slopes in NSW and north-east Victoria at 200Ã1300 m above sea level (NSW OEH 2011b). The species is predominantly found along the western-flowing streams and their headwaters of the Great Dividing Range, and a small number of eastern-flowing streams in the north end of its range (Spark 2009). The Booroolong Frog occurs along 520 km of stream across 56 streams in 28 creeks and rivers (Hunter 2013a). Its range extends from Tamworth in northern NSW to the Southern Highlands in Victoria (TSSC 2007k). Though this represents a large extent of occurrence, the area of occupancy of the species is likely to represent only a tiny portion of this range (TSSC 2007k). Within Victoria the species has been recorded at Burrowye Creek at Burrowye and on the Murray River at Jingellic (Gillespie & Hunter 1999), both sites are freehold pastoral land (Clemann 2003a). Historic range: The species has disappeared from 50% of its known range since the mid 1980s (Hunter 2013a). Declines have been most noticeable in the New England Tablelands (Anstis et al. 1998; Heatwole et al. 1995; Hunter 2013a), although it still occurs in the Namoi and Manning catchments in the southern part of this area (Gillespie 1999, 2000; Spark 2009). Declines have also occurred in the central and southern parts of the species' range (Gillespie 1999, 2000; Hunter 2007). Monitoring of populations on the south-west slopes and central tablelands indicates extinction of the species from two of the 13 monitored sites, which is an indication that declines are ongoing (Hunter 2013a). Previously known populations from the Blue Mountains are extinct (NSW SC 2005b). There are no records supported by photos or specimens from eastern flowing streams south of Sydney (NSW OEH 2011b).

The flowers eventually develop into small elliptical fruits which are 3 -5 mm long (Alexander 1999).,https://data.rbg.vic.gov.au/cip/preview/image/library/79148?maxsize=512,Neville Walsh,"Previous Habitat:Previous records indicate the Southern Shepherd's Purse occupying moss mats on seepage areas in open situations. The species was known to occur in stony or rocky areas on the volcanic plains south-west of Melbourne (Nevill & Camilleri 2010). It was also found on low granite hills and mountains, including Mount Emu, Mount Cole, Mount Langi Ghiran and Mount Buangor in western Victoria. In Tasmania the species is presumed extinct, however it was reported from dry, stony sites and banks of streams (Curtis & Morris 1975).Habitat at Mount Alexander:The Southern Shepherd's Purse appears to have very specific and finely balanced habitat requirements. At Mount Alexander, the species occurs on gently to steeply sloping granite rockplates, usually with an easterly or south-westerly aspect. It grows on seasonally moist moss mats on a shallow soil layer and occasionally growing directly in shallow soil pockets. It is not found on moss mats that utilize deeper soils (Alexander 2004). Sites in which it occurs are usually open, containing only light canopy cover from surrounding trees including the Manna Gum, Eucalyptus viminalis, and Messmate Stringybark, Eucalyptus oblique. The habitat is classified as Granitic Hills Woodland Ecological Vegetation (Nevill & Camilleri 2010). Southern Shepherd's Purse shares this moss mat habitat with a diversity of other indigenous annual and geophytic vascular plants which are typical of seasonally moist or rocky sites in central and northern Victoria. The most dominant of these species is Breutelia affinis, with other common species including Bartramia papillata, Bryum billardeiri, Campylopus introflexus, Grimmia pulvinata, and Polytrichum juniperinum. Other native flora species sharing this moss mat habitat include Dwarf Arrow-grass, Triglochin centrocarpa, Rayless Daisy, Brachyscome perpusilla, Yellow Pennywort, Hydrocotyle foveolata, Moss Sunray, Hyalosperma demissum, Common Bow-flower, Millotia muelleri, Tiny Star, Hypoxis glabella, Adder's Tongue, Ophioglossum lusitanicum, Common Sunray, Triptilodiscus pygmaeus, Spoon Cudweed, Stuartina muelleri, Small Wrinklewort, Siloxerus multiflora, Sieber Crassula, Crassula sieberiana, Pink Purslane, Calandrinia calyptrata, Small Purslane, Calandrinia eremea and Tiny Purslane, Calandrinia granulifera (Cook 1998). Stands of Southern Shepherd's Purse are usually discrete, in areas with a light canopy of Manna Gum and more rarely Messmate (Alexander 1999).","The Southern Shepherd's Purse was recorded last century from central-west and western Victoria and from central to northern Tasmania (Hewson 1982b). It was presumed extinct until rediscovered in Victoria in 1983. In 1998 approximately 12 200 plants were recorded at six sites on Mt Alexander (Mt Alexander Regional Park), near Castlemaine in central Victoria (Alexander 1999; DNRE 2000, SAC 1995b).

However, midstream snags are also an important habitat component (NSW Fisheries 2001).In the Murray River below Yarrawonga Weir, Trout Cod inhabit a large (60ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ100 m wide), deep (>3 m) flowing river section with a sand, silt and clay substrate that contains abundant snags and woody debris. Trout Cod are often angled from within, under or adjacent to snags, branch piles, and steep clay banks, usually in areas of relatively fast current (Douglas et al. 1994). In a study by Brown and colleagues (1998), Trout Cod were only found in snag piles that were typically opposite sandy beaches or on outside bends. There is a degree of overlap with the habitat requirements of Murray Cod and therefore competition between these two species is likely (Brown et al. 1998). As a large proportion of the streams that the Trout Cod originally inhabited are now degraded, it is difficult to accurately determine the habitat requirements of the species (Reed 1995). Several authors (Cadwallader & Backhouse 1983; Lake 1971; Llewellyn & MacDonald 1980) believe Trout Cod to be more common in the cooler waters of the upper reaches of streams.Seven Creeks (Victoria) is a relatively narrow stream (5ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ7 m wide) with shallow (<2 m) pools interspersed by rapids and cascades (up to 4 m in height) (Douglas et al. 1994). Here, the species occurs in fast-flowing water over bedrock, boulder and sand-gravel substrates. Larger fish occur in deep holes between falls and rapids while the smaller fish shelter beneath and amongst boulders. Juveniles have been found in pools in a steep rocky section of the Seven Creeks system (Cadwallader & Backhouse 1983). In Seven Creeks, partitioning of habitat use was evident with adults utilising pools and smaller juveniles utilising the riffle complexes (areas of a stream or river characterised by a rocky substrate and turbulent, fast-moving, shallow water) (NSW DPI 2006).A Trout Cod radio tracking study has been conducted in a 40 km reach of the Murray River, downstream of Lake Mulwala (Koehn & Nicol 2014). This river in this region is a ""large, lowland river situated on low-gradient riverine plains, with low energy, and is characterised by meandering bends. The species was strongly associated with structural woody habitat (>68% cover), deeper (>2.4 m), slower water (<0.2 m s<sup>-1</sup>) closer to the river bank. Murray Cod and Trout Cod were found in deeper and faster water, and deeper in the water column, than other tracked species (Golden Perch (Macquaria ambigua) and Carp (Cyprinus carpio)). The species only uses a small proportion of habitat, and is strongly influenced by the presence of structural woody debris (Koehn & Nicol 2014).","The Trout Cod is known from a single natural population, two stable translocated populations and many stocked populations. All stocked sites require continued stocking and there is only limited evidence that some stocked populations are self sustaining (NSW DPI n.d.).Natural Population:The natural distribution of Trout Cod has declined since European settlement. The single naturally occurring population is restricted to a small (approximately 120 km) stretch of the Murray River from below Yarrawonga Weir to Strathmerton (Douglas et al. 1994; NSW Fisheries 2001; Rimmer 1987), but is occasionally taken downstream as far as the Barmah State Forest (McKinnon 1993) and further downstream to Gunbower (Douglas et al. 2012). Unconfirmed records have also been made further downstream from near Murrabit, Swan Hill and near Tooleybuc (Douglas et al. 2012).Translocated Populations:The Trout Cod was beenÃÂ introduced between 1921 and 1922ÃÂ toÃÂ Seven Creeks (a tributary of the Goulburn River) in Victoria (Cadwallader & Backhouse 1983; Ingram & Richardson 1989; Ingram et al. 1990). The populationÃÂ now occurs upstream of Euroa between Gooram Falls and Polly McQuinns Weir (Reed 1995), for a distance of about 8 km (Douglas et al. 1994).The Trout Cod was introduced prior to 1918 to Cataract Dam in coastal NSW (outside the species range). The population is thought to have hybridised with Murray Cod (M. peelii peelii) (Douglas et al. 1994;ÃÂ Gehrke & Harris 1996; Rimmer 1988). Trout Cod from the Ovens River were introduced into Lake Sambell (an artificial lake at Beechworth, Victoria) in 1928 and the species was common here until an unexplained fish kill in the 1970s (Berra & Weatherley 1972; Cadwallader & Backhouse 1983).Stocked Populations:Since the mid 1980s bothÃÂ the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and the VictorianÃÂ DPI have been operating a breeding and conservation stocking program for the Trout Cod. This program has resulted in Trout Cod being stocked at numerous sites throughout their former distribution in the Murray-Darling River system of Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Between 1986 and 2005, over one million Trout Cod (826 000 from Narrandera Fisheries Centre in NSW and the remainder from Snob's Creek Hatchery in Victoria), were released as fingerlings or juveniles into a range of selected sites (Harris & Rowland 1996; NSW DPI 2005).Stocking sites include the Murray, Murrumbidgee, Macquarie and Abercrombie River catchments in NSW; the Goulburn, Ovens, Broken, Coliban and Mitta Mitta River catchments in Victoria; and the Murrumbidgee River catchment in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT Government 1999a; Brown et al. 1998; Douglas et al. 1994; Faragher et al. 1993).In NSW, stocked populations occur in the upper Murray River above the Hume Dam, upper Murrumbidgee River between Adaminaby and Murrells Crossing, near Cooma, middle sections of the Murrumbidgee River from Burrinjuck to Yanco Weir, the Macquarie River near Dubbo and Talbingo Dam in the Kosciusko National Park. The primary stocking sites in NSW include Angle Crossing, Wantabadgery, Collingullie, Narrandera and Yanco in the Murrumbidgee River system and Namina Falls and Devils Elbow in the Macquarie River System. To date, recruitment of stocked populations has been detected in the Murrumbidgee River at Angle Crossing and Narrandera (Gilligan 2005).Historic Distribution:Trout Cod were once widespread throughout the southern tributaries of the Murray-Darling system, including tributaries of the Murray River in Victoria, the Murrumbidgee (including upland tributaries in the ACT), and the upper half of the Macquarie River (NSW DPI 2005). In 1971, Lake (1971) noted that the species was extremely rare upstream of the Murray River at Yarrawonga, where it has been common 20 years before. Except for the first officially reported Trout Cod and one other unconfirmed report, there have been no further documented reports of Trout Cod occurring naturally in the Macquarie River system. Trout Cod have never been recorded in the Lachlan River (Douglas et al. 1994), however they must have occurred historically in this system as their distribution includes both neighbouring rivers to the north and south (NSW DPI 2005).",144.25,-36.72

DPI 2011; Walsh 1994). Leaves, often folded or in-rolled, grow 25 cm (Murphy 2010) to 30 cm long (Vic. DPI 2011) and 2 mm (Murphy 2010) to 3.5 mm wide (Vic. DPI 2011). The inflorescences are delicate, open, up to 25 cm in length and remain partly enclosed by the upper leaf sheath until late maturity, often drying to a pale golden colour. Panicles (the separate branched cluster of flowers that form the flowerhead) detach from the plant when mature and are blown away by wind. The light green, or occasionally purple-tinged, spikelets (small spikes that form the 'flower') are 2.5 mm (Vic DPI 2011) to 4 mm in length (Murphy 2010), with the upper glume (modified leaf or scale at base of a grass spikelet) longer than the lower glume. Lemmas (outer or lower modified leaves or scales) have fine, straight, or gently curved, awns (bristle-like appendages found on the spikelets) that are 1.5-3 mm in length and are attached towards the top, being only just visible beyond the tip of the spikelet (Murphy 2010; Vic. DPI 2011).Environmental conditions and site characteristics determine the species' habit, with plants at drier sites generally smaller and with fewer inflorescences than those at moister sites. In ephemeral (not lasting) habitat, the species is an annual (dies off each year), whilst in continuous moist sites the species is perennial (lasting for many years) (Murphy 2010).",http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vroimages.nsf/Images/sip_adamsons_blown_grass/$File/adamsons_blown_grass_plants.jpg,A J Brown,"Adamson's Blown-grass is confined to slow moving creeks, swamps, flats, depressions or drainage lines (such as along roadsides) that are seasonally inundated or waterlogged and usually moderately to highly saline (Murphy 2010; Vic.

Plants appear to favour sites that have some shelter from the wind, often provided by other species such as Canary-grass (Phalaris aquatica), Juncus spp. or Gahnia spp. (Moorrees 2004). This preference for protected sites may explain why plants are rarely found around larger, more open, exposed saline lakes. The species will also tolerate some waterlogging, but will not survive in relatively deep water for any length of time (Moorrees 2004).Associated species include Streaked Arrowgrass (Triglochin striata), Plains Saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia stricta var. perlaxa), Australian Salt-grass (Distichlis distichophylla), Common Blown-grass (Lachnagrostis filiformis), Beaded Glasswort (Sarcocornia quinqueflora), Creeping Monkey-flower (Mimulus repens), Salt Pratia (Pratia platycalyx), Creeping Brookweed (Samolus repens), Selleria (Selleria radicans) and Round-leaf Wilsonia (Wilsonia rotundifolia) (Murphy 2010).

The adult female, more colourful than the male, has a chestnut-coloured head, with white around the eye and a white crown stripe, and metallic green back and wings, barred with black and chestnut. There is a pale stripe extending from the shoulder into a V down its upper back. The adult male is similar to the female, but is smaller and duller with buff spots on the wings and without any chestnut colouring on the head, nape or throat (D. Ingwersen 2007, pers. comm.; NSW NPWS 2006).This species is generally seen singly or in pairs, or less often in small flocks (Marchant & Higgins 1993). Flocking occurs during the breeding season, when adults sometimes form loose gatherings around a group of nests. Flocks can also form after the breeding season, and at some locations small groups regularly occur. Groups comprising of a male and up to six offspring have been observed (D. Ingwersen 2007, pers. comm.; Marchant & Higgins 1993).",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Australian_Painted-Snipe_female_Nov02.JPG/220px-Australian_Painted-Snipe_female_Nov02.JPG,Aviceda,"The Australian Painted Snipe generally inhabits shallow terrestrial freshwater (occasionally brackish) wetlands, including temporary and permanent lakes, swamps and claypans. They also use inundated or waterlogged grassland or saltmarsh, dams, rice crops, sewage farms and bore drains. Typical sites include those with rank emergent tussocks of grass, sedges, rushes or reeds, or samphire; often with scattered clumps of lignum Muehlenbeckia or canegrass or sometimes tea-tree (Melaleuca). The Australian Painted Snipe sometimes utilises areas that are lined with trees, or that have some scattered fallen or washed-up timber (Marchant & Higgins 1993).Australian Painted Snipe breeding habitat requirements may be quite specific: shallow wetlands with areas of bare wet mud and both upper and canopy cover nearby. Nest records are all, or nearly all, from or near small islands in freshwater wetlands (D. Rogers 2002, pers. comm.), provided that these islands are a combination of very shallow water, exposed mud, dense low cover and sometimes some tall dense cover (Rogers et al. 2005). The Australian Painted Snipe has also been recorded nesting in and near swamps, canegrass swamps, flooded areas including samphire, grazing land, among cumbungi, sedges, grasses, salt water couch (Paspalum), saltbush (Halosarcia) and grass, also in ground cover of water-buttons and grasses, at the base of tussocks and under low saltbush (Marchant & Higgins 1993). One nest has been found in the centre of a cow-pat in a clump of long grass (Marchant & Higgins 1993). The nest is usually placed in a scrape in the ground (Pringle 1987), and either has scant lining or is a shallow bowl-shaped nest of dry grass or other plant material (Marchant & Higgins 1993). The closely related Rostratula benghalensis nests on the ground, sometimes on low hummocks or mounds, normally concealed in thick marshy vegetation. They sometimes nest in more open aquatic environments e.g. on a dense mat of floating water weed. Nests are usually lined with leaves and stems, and are occasionally built up with interwoven plant material, but infrequently bare (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The Australian Painted Snipe can use modified habitats, such as low-lying woodlands converted to grazing pasture, sewage farms, dams, bores and irrigation schemes (Marchant & Higgins 1993), however they do not necessarily breed in such habitats (D. Rogers 2002, pers. comm.). The Australian Painted Snipe loafs on the ground under clumps of lignum, tea-tree and similar dense bushes (Marchant & Higgins 1993). This species has been recorded foraging under clumps of tea-trees (Leach et al. 1987) but most records are from daytime roost sites and the foraging habitat requirements of this species are not well understood and may be quite specific (D. Rogers 2002, pers. comm.).This species requires suitable wetland areas even in drought conditions. The species can move to suitable habitat if necessary (Marchant & Higgins 1993).The Australian Painted Snipe is not known to associate with any other species or subspecies of fauna or flora that are listed as threatened under the EPBC Act. ","The Australian Painted Snipe has been recorded at wetlands in all states of Australia (Barrett et al. 2003; Blakers et al. 1984; Hall 1910b). It is most common in eastern Australia, where it has been recorded at scattered locations throughout much of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. It has been recorded less frequently at a smaller number of more scattered locations farther west in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia (Barrett et al. 2003; Blakers et al. 1984; Marchant & Higgins 1993; Rogers et al. 2005). It has also been recorded on single occasions in south-eastern Tasmania (Hall 1910b) and at Lord Howe Island (NSW NPWS 1999b).The extent of occurrence of the Australian Painted Snipe is estimated, with low reliability, to be 4 500 000 kmÃÂ² (Garnett & Crowley 2000). A comparison of recent and historical records published in Rogers and colleagues (2005) provides no compelling evidence of a change in the extent of occurrence. The extent of occurrence is accordingly suspected to be stable at the present time (Garnett & Crowley 2000).The area of occupancy of the Australian Painted Snipe is estimated, with low reliability, to be 1000 kmÃÂ² (Garnett & Crowley 2000). The area of occupancy has undoubtedly declined as approximately 50% of wetlands in Australia have been removed since European settlement (Environment Australia 1997). It is difficult to pinpoint locations of decline because the Australian Painted Snipe has been recorded in recent years at scattered sites throughout much of its historical range, and is recorded only infrequently at most sites, the latter making it difficult to determine if its absence from a site is temporary or permanent (Lane & Rogers 2000; Rogers et al. 2005). A comparison of recent and historical records published in Rogers and colleagues (2005) shows that there have not been any recent records of the Australian Painted Snipe from north-western NSW, or from a number of scattered other locations from which historical records were obtained. Rogers and colleagues (2005) also state that there have been no recent records from south-central Queensland. In 2007, however, a female was observed at a nest in the Diamantina Channel country, and an unconfirmed report was received from the Longreach area in the same year (D. Ingwersen 2007, pers. comm.). The Australian Painted Snipe has also been recorded at several new locations in recent years (Rogers et al. 2005), but these are fewer in number than the locations that have seemingly been abandoned. A substantial decline in the overall reporting rate of the snipe since the 1950s, despite an increase in survey effort in recent decades, further suggests that the snipe is now less widespread than it once was (Lane & Rogers 2000; Rogers et al. 2005). In light of this evidence, the area of occupancy is suspected to be decreasing at the present time (Garnett & Crowley 2000).",144.8,-37.72

The leaves are all or mostly basal (in a rosette), with leaves on the short stems, if present, being opposite. The rosette leaves are on leaf-stalks between 2 and 6 cm long, with leaf blades egg-shaped in outline, between 1 and 2.5 cm long and 1 to 2 cm wide. The leaves are entire or shallowly lobed; most commonly with 5 to 7 lobes and with scalloped margins. The leaf surface is minutely furry along the veins and near the edges. The flowering stems are to 15 cm tall, and terminate with an umbrella-like flower-cluster with 1 to 3 (and sometimes to 7) flowers that are borne on stalks between 1 and 2 cm long. The flowers have 5 petals that are wider at their tips than at their bases and are between 8 and 11 mm long. The flowers are in various shades of pale pink and each petal is marked with darker crimson or purple branching stripes that run down to the center of the flower. Flowers have 10 stamens. The fruit, 10 to 15 mm long, is a dry structure that splits into 5 segments. The fruit is elongated and shaped like a stork's bill, hence the plant's common name. Flowering is from October to March, with the peak flowering occurring in November and December. Seeds ripen and are shed about five weeks after flowering.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Pelargonium_benambra.jpg/220px-Pelargonium_benambra.jpg,Melburnian,,,147.6956,-36.9558
