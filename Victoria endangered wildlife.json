The undersides and sides may appear mottled with light coloured circular scars caused by various types of parasites, including scars from the bite of the 'cookie-cutter' shark ( Isistius brasiliensis) (Aguilar 2002).At sexual maturity, sei whales are approximately 12-16 m long, although they can reach lengths of 17.7 m in males and 21 m in females (Gambell 1985). Adult females are about 0.5-0.6 m longer than males, and sei whales of the Southern Hemisphere are larger than those of the Northern Hemisphere (Horwood 1987). The body of the sei whale is slim, streamlined and laterally compressed in the caudal (hind) region.Sounds of the sei whale consist of a series of short pulses with peak energy in the 1.5-3.5 kHz range (Richardson et al. 1995). During a recent Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (SO-GLOBEC) cruise, acoustic recordings accompanied by photographs and acoustic tracking of a group of sei whales feeding in the Western Antarctic Peninsula provided the first confirmed description of sei whale sounds. Vocalisations included a series of \"growly\" type calls, with tonal calls having abrupt shifts in a much lower dominant frequency (~200-400 Hz) (McDonald & Thiele 2004, pers. comm.).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Sei_whale_mother_and_calf_Christin_Khan_NOAA.jpg","Image_Author":"Christin Khan","Habitat":"The Australian Antarctic waters are important feeding grounds for sei whales, as are temperate, cool waters (Horwood 1987).

Breeding occurs in tropical and subtropical waters.","Australian_Distribution":"Sei whales have been infrequently recorded in Australian waters (Bannister et al. 1996). The similarity in appearance of sei whales and Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni) has resulted in confusion about distributional limits and frequency of occurrence, particularly in warmer waters (>20 \u00c2\u00b0C) where Bryde's whales are more common. Sei whales were thought to be the most common whales reported by whalers off Albany, Western Australia while hunting sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), however, these may have been misidentified Bryde's whales (Bannister et al. 1996). There are several reports of presumed sei whale sightings by fishermen around the shelf edge (50 km offshore) off the coast of NSW. A trawled carcass of a sei whale was reported within 300 km of the Northern Territory coast (Chatto & Warneke 2000). There is one record of a sei whale stranding for Tasmania in 1963 (Warneke 2004, pers. comm.) and another stranding of a sei whale in Tasmania in 1980 (McManus et al. 1984).","Longitude":null,"Latitude":null},{"Scientific_Name":"Balaenoptera musculus","Common_Name":"Blue Whale","Threatened_Status":"Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":36,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=36","Family":"Balaenopteridae","Genus":"Balaenoptera","Species":"musculus","Description":"Both the Antarctic blue whale and pygmy blue whale have common phenotypic traits such as grey skin with mottled patterns, which enables identification of individuals. When submerged, the blue whale appears to be a luminous pale blue or aqua. They have a pronounced 'splashguard' in front of their blowholes, with a single pronounced longitudinal ridge leading forward on the rostrum. Their blow is tall and powerful (approximately 10 m). They have a long, smooth back with a small, variably-shaped dorsal fin set towards the tail (Jefferson et al. 1993). Differences between the two subspecies were first determined by whaling catches in the austral summer feeding season (Attard et al. 2010).Differences between the pygmy blue whale and the Antarctic blue whale include:<ul>\r<li><strong>Morphology</strong>: the Antarctic blue whale is the largest of the two subspecies growing to maximum lengths of over 30 m; in comparison, the pygmy blue whale is recorded growing to 24.1 m (Branch et al. 2009, Attard et al. 2010).

The Antarctic blue whale tends to remain at higher latitudes and migrate to lower latitudes for feeding, breeding and calving during the Australian summer, whilst some remain within the Antarctic waters year-round (Branch 2007, \u00c3\u0085\u00c2\u00a0irovic et al. 2009).

The undersides of the flippers and flukes are also white. The head is asymmetrical in colour and is mostly dark but the right lower jaw is white. Baleen plates are black on the left jaw and white on the right jaw. The body is free of mottling or extensive scarring (Leatherwood & Reeves 1983).The fin whale is the second-largest whale species, after the blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus). Adult whales range between 20 and 27 m long and weigh more than 70 tonnes. As with other baleen whales, female fin whales grow to a larger size than males (Aguilar & Lockyer 1987). The fin whale is very streamlined in appearance, with a distinct ridge along the back behind the dorsal fin. The dorsal fin is set two-thirds of the way along the back, and is up to 60 cm tall, curved and often slopes backwards (Leatherwood & Reeves 1983).Fin whales are more gregarious than other baleen whales, and often occur in groups of 6-10, though single animals and pairs are more common. Aggregations of over 100 whales may be observed on feeding grounds (Watkins et al. 1987).Recordings of regular, pulsed sounds, seemingly of mechanical origin, attracted considerable military interest in the 1950s, and eventually these sounds were conclusively linked to sightings of fin whales (Schevill et al. 1964). Fin whale sounds are mostly 20 Hz or 22 Hz and are short, low-frequency tonal sequences (Nieukirk et al. 2004). Pulsed sounds include a \"rumble\" which is a call of very long duration (about 30 seconds), in the frequency range of 10-30 Hz with extensive frequency and amplitude modulation. The association of these sounds with the reproductive season suggests that they may be used in reproductive displays by males (Watkins et al. 1987).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Finhval_%281%29.jpg/1597px-Finhval_%281%29.jpg","Image_Author":"Aqqa Rosing-Asvid","Habitat":"The Australian Antarctic waters are important feeding grounds for fin whales.

Fin whale strandings have been reported in small numbers from Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania (Bannister et al. 1996). Two strandings have been reported in South Australia: one in 1925 off Port Wakefield, the other in 1999 north of Port Lincoln. One stranding was reported in Victoria in 1956 (Larcombe et al. 2002). Two strandings have been reported in Western Australia: one yearling in 1951 near Mandurah, the other in 1996 at Cottesloe (Chittleborough 1996). There are three records of fin whale strandings in Tasmania (McManus et al. 1984). Chittleborough (1996) reported that nine fin whales were taken during the whaling season in Western Australia between 1912 and 1937 and another three in the whaling seasons of 1953, 1956 and 1959. Fin whales have been sighted inshore in the proximity of the Bonney Upwelling, Victoria, in the summer and autumn months during aerial surveys (Gill 2002). Fin whale acoustics have been heard off the Rottnest Trench, Western Australia, between January and April 2000 (McCauley et al. 2000).","Longitude":null,"Latitude":null},{"Scientific_Name":"Megaptera novaeangliae","Common_Name":"Humpback Whale","Threatened_Status":"Vulnerable","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":38,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=38","Family":"Balaenopteridae","Genus":"Megaptera","Species":"novaeangliae","Description":"The humpback whale is a moderately large baleen whale. The maximum recorded length is 17.4 m, and females are generally 1.0-1.5 m longer than males (Chittleborough 1965). Southern Hemisphere humpback whales generally have a greater degree of white colouration on their ventral surface compared to darker Northern Hemisphere whales but there is no genetic evidence to support the need for subspecies status (Baker et al. 1990). The humpback whale has distinctive markings on the ventral side and trailing edge of their flukes as well as on their dorsal fins and flanks that are used for individual identification (Katona et al. 1979; Kniest et al. 2010). Their dorsal fin is distinctive from other balaenopterid whales as they have a hump on the leading edge of their dorsal fin.The humpback whale produces a variety of sounds throughout their habitat range. These sounds can be used for foraging, when in distress and in non-mating, social circumstances (Clapham 2000). The most studied vocalisations are songs produced by solitary males. The song frequency ranges from less than 20 Hz to 8 kHz (Payne & McVay 1971; Tyack 1981). A whale can sing for a period of minutes to hours and the song can vary over a range of frequencies with more powerful parts of the song audible over several kilometres underwater (Cato 1991). The exact function of male humpback whale song has yet to be determined but it is believed to be an integral part of male behaviour as a form of sexual display (Tyack 1981). Feeding ground song has only recently been recorded from a Southern Ocean Antarctic feeding area, where song transmission has been hypothesised as a form of cultural transmission between the neighbouring South Pacific populations (Garland et al. 2013).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Humpback_Whale_underwater_shot.jpg","Image_Author":null,"Habitat":"Migration and Resting: East Coast Population: The eastern Australian humpback whales also migrate in close proximity to the coast of Australia on their way to and from their winter breeding areas (Cato 1991; Paterson et al. 1994; Noad & Cato 2001; Noad 2002). As with the western Australian population, the eastern Australian population also tend to migrate further offshore during their northward migration (Paterson et al. 1994; Noad & Cato 2001). Three major aggregation areas have been previously identified for the eastern Australian population in Queensland around the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef, Hervey Bay and in the Gold Coast region (DEH 2005b). The southern end of the Great Barrier Reef is a suspected calving area (Chaloupka et al. 1999; Smith et al. 2012) while Hervey Bay is considered to be an important resting area (Chaloupka et al. 1999; Paterson et al. 2001; Franklin et al. 2010). On the southward migration, as many as 30% of the eastern Australian population may use Hervey Bay as a resting area (Paterson et al. 2001; Franklin et al. 2010). The breeding area for the eastern population of the humpback whale is presumed to be off the coast between central and northern Queensland (Chittleborough 1965; Dawbin 1966; Smith et al. 2012). Although the exact location is still unknown, recent research using a predictive habitat model developed from incidental sightings data, has isolated two core areas for humpback whale distribution in the southern Great Barrier Reef region: east of Mackay; and further south in the Capricorn and Bunker island groups off Gladstone (Smith et al. 2012). The model identified key habitat parameters of a water depth of 30 to 58 m and sea surface temperatures of 21 to 23 \u00c2\u00a1C. Data collected from satellite tagged whales supported these areas as key areas for the humpback whale in the region. The area east of Mackay (19.5\u00c2\u00a1 S to 21.5\u00c2\u00a1 S) is thought to be an important breeding area whereas the area further south in the Capricorn and Bunker island groups may be used as an important migratory area (Smith et al. 2012). Although further research is required to conclusively identify critical breeding habitats for the humpback whale, the research by Smith and colleagues (2012) has identified key areas on which to focus future surveys. West Coast Population: There are additional areas of potential importance as resting areas around Houtman Abrolhos, Montebello and Barrow islands, although this is still to be determined conclusively (Jenner et al. 2001). During the northern migration, the whales tend to remain further off-shore (Jenner at al. 2001). Data collected from satellite tagged whales found that median distances from shore were less than 25 km and thus in shallow water (<40 m water depth). In the region around Camden Sound however, the median distance from shore was 50 km (<300 m water depth) with the maximum distance recorded over 200 km. Areas such as Shark Bay may also provide resting areas during the northern migration (Jenner at al. 2001). Major breeding areas have been identified for the western Australian population in the Kimberley region and particularly between Lacepede Islands (16.8\u00c2\u00a1 S) and Camden Sound (15.38\u00c2\u00a1 S) (Jenner et al. 2001). Camden sound appears to be the northern most limit for the majority of west coast whales and is considered to be an important breeding area (Jenner et al. 2001). Double and colleagues (2010) found that satellite tagged whales in the area of Camden sound tended to move in an inconsistent direction, which suggests this area is used for breeding.","Australian_Distribution":"Both the east coast and west coast Australian populations make their annual migrations between breeding areas in tropical waters along the east and west coast of Australia (15\u00c2\u00b0 S to 20\u00c2\u00b0 S) and feeding areas in the Antarctic (south of 56\u00c2\u00b0 S) (Chittleborough 1965; Dawbin 1966). The east Australian population is currently believed to rely predominately on a feeding area that is between 130\u00c2\u00b0 E and 170\u00c2\u00b0 W and the west Australian population on a feeding area that is between 70\u00c2\u00b0 E and 130\u00c2\u00b0 E (Chittleborough 1965; IWC 2005, 2006).","Longitude":145.779,"Latitude":-38.676},{"Scientific_Name":"Eubalaena australis","Common_Name":"Southern Right Whale","Threatened_Status":"Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":40,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=40","Family":"Balaenidae","Genus":"Eubalaena","Species":"australis","Description":"The southern right whale is a large baleen whale with a less streamlined shape than balaenopterids like the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). They grow to a maximum length of 17.5 m and weight of 80 t, with mature females often slightly larger than males (Bannister et al. 1996). The mean length of sexually mature females off the South African coast was calculated as 13.85 m (Best & Ruther 1992) and off Argentina as 13.66 m (Whitehead & Payne 1981). Mature females in Soviet catches from the Southern Ocean averaged 14.34 m (Tormosov et al. 1998). Southern Right Whales are about 5.5 m long and 1000-1500 kg at birth and physical maturity is reached at a length of 16 m (Bannister et al. 1996). Age at physical maturity is unknown (Bannister et al. 1996). The vast majority of southern right whale individuals are uniformly black in colour, often with a white ventral blaze of varying size and shape centred on the umbilicus. About 2.8 % of adults are mottled dark brown to grey, having been white with varying degrees of black marking at birth (Bannister 1990). A small number of adults (1.4-3.4 %) have white dorsal blazing (Bannister 1990). The pectoral fins are short and paddle like, the flukes are uniform in colour with smooth trailing edges, and there is no dorsal fin. A distinctive feature is the presence of whitish or yellowish callosities on the rostrum, chin and lower jaw. These are formed as roughened patches of keratinised skin and colonised by cyamids (small crustaceans known as 'whale lice') (Cummings 1985a). Callosity patterns are present at birth and persist with minor variation through life, such that individual southern right whales can be identified by the number and configuration of callosities (Payne et al. 1983). They provide the basis for studies relying on an ability to recognise individuals from natural markings over long time frames (Best 1990e; Burnell & Bryden 1997; Payne 1986). The southern right whale head is large compared to body size and the jaw line strongly arched (Jefferson et al. 1993). Baleen plates number from 205-270 and the baleen is usually, dark, very fine, and long (maximum 2.2 m) in comparison to other species (Cummings 1985a). Blubber thickness has been recorded from Soviet catch data as 14-17 cm for a 10 m whale and 23-24 cm for a 15 m whale (Tormosov et al. 1998).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Southern_right_whale6.jpg","Image_Author":"Micha\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098l CATANZARITI","Habitat":"Feeding Habitat: The feeding habitat of the southern right whale is very poorly known and there have been no dedicated studies in feeding areas. Based on sightings information, most feeding areas are thought to be in deeper offshore waters ranging from sub-Antarctic areas to locations south of 60\u00c2\u00a1 S (Bannister et al. 1997, 1999; Goodall & Galeazzi 1986; Ohsumi & Kasamatsu 1986; Tormosov et al. 1998) in areas probably associated with climatic and environmental conditions generating high productivity. A single coastal feeding area has been identified off the west coast of Africa where upwelling and thermocline development is apparent, and oceanographic conditions are thought to provide suitable feeding conditions (Best et al. 2002). Breeding Habitat: Differential use of habitat by calving and non-calving whales has been noted off Australia (Burnell & Bryden 1997), South Africa (Best 1981) and Argentina (Payne 1986), perhaps implying habitat selection within calving grounds. The southern right whale prefers near-shore, shallow water depths and being in close proximity to other individuals whilst on calving grounds in Australian waters (Pirzl 2008). In breeding areas, non-calving whales are highly social whilst calving whales remain apart from robust socialising groups (Pirzl 2008). Habitat selection and habitat use on Australian calving grounds is influenced by breeding status and/or the type of calving ground, in addition to other environmental factors such as swell height (Pirzl 2008). The southern right whale is constrained in their ability to colonise unused areas of potentially suitable habitat due to a high degree of site fidelity (individuals returning to the same breeding site each year). This combined with previous exploitation history suggesting extirpation of migratory traditions to these sites (Carroll et al. 2015; Pirzl 2008).","Australian_Distribution":"The southern right whale is seasonally present along the Australian coast between late April and early November.

Vegetation associations: Across the species' range, the New Holland Mouse is known to inhabit the following types of habitat  (Fox & Fox 1978; Fox & Mckay 1981; Hocking 1980; Keith & Calaby 1968; Lazenby et al. 2008; Norton 1987; Posamentier & Recher 1974; Pye 1991; Wilson 1991): open heathland, open woodland with a healthland understorey.","Australian_Distribution":"General distribution: The New Holland Mouse has a fragmented distribution across Tasmania, Victoria, NSW and Queensland. The species is now largely restricted to the coast of central and northern NSW, with one inland occurrence near Parkes (ACT ESDD 2013). In 2006, there were six to eight metapopulations of the species based on data from the NSW Atlas of Wildlife, the Victorian Atlas of Wildlife and the Tasmanian Natural Values Atlas (TSSC 2010j). At a landscape scale, the species appears to be clumped in its distribution, most likely due to its specific habitat requirements (Braithwaite & Gullan 1978; Fox & Fox 1978; Fox & Mckay 1981; Posamentier & Recher 1974). Historically, there were eleven metapopulations (TSSC 2010j). Lack of survey data: A high percentage of New Holland Mouse populations were not surveyed between 1999 and 2009 (TSSC 2010j), and thus, it is difficult to estimate the species' actual distribution. However, given the number of sites from which the species is known to have disappeared between 1999 and 2009, it is possible that the species' distribution is actually less than current estimates (TSSC 2010j).","Longitude":145.18,"Latitude":-38.27},{"Scientific_Name":"Conilurus albipes","Common_Name":"White-footed Rabbit-rat, Parroo, White-footed Tree-rat","Threatened_Status":"Extinct","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":131,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=131","Family":"Muridae","Genus":"Conilurus","Species":"albipes","Description":"The White-footed Rabbit-rat was an attractive squirrel-like rodent with a combined head and body length of 23 -26 cm and a tail length of 22 -24 cm.

As all specimens were collected during the first half of the 19th century, most descriptions of the animal come from the work of Gould (1863), who worked in Australia in the 1840s. Gould described this species as having long, soft fur which was grey with ashy-brown tips. The back of the animal had many fine black hairs that were intermixed with these brown tips. The whiskers were black and there was a narrow black line around the eye. The underside of the animal, the inner surface of the limbs and the feet were white.

It is the only Australian flying-fox that has a collar of orange/brown fully encircling its neck (Hall 1987). Thick leg fur extends to the ankle, in contrast to other  Pteropus species in which it only reaches the knee (Hall 1987; Tidemann 1998). As its name implies, the head is covered by light grey fur (Hall 1987). The belly fur is grey, often with flecks of white and ginger. The fur on the back shows two morphs which could be related to age, moult or sub-population (Hall & Richards 2000). One morph has dark grey fur and the other has a pronounced silver or frosted appearance (Luckoff undated pers. comm. cited in Hall 1987).

It is a canopy-feeding frugivore and nectarivore, which utilises vegetation communities including rainforests, open forests, closed and open woodlands, Melaleuca swamps and Banksia woodlands. It also feeds on commercial fruit crops and on introduced tree species in urban areas. The primary food source is blossom from Eucalyptus and related genera but in some areas it also utilises a wide range of rainforest fruits (Eby 1998). None of the vegetation communities used by the Grey-headed Flying-fox produce continuous foraging resources throughout the year. As a result, the species has adopted complex migration traits in response to ephemeral and patchy food resources (Duncan et al. 1999; Eby 1996, 1998; Nelson 1965a; Parry-Jones & Augee 1992; Spencer et al. 1991).","Australian_Distribution":"Current distribution: The Grey-headed Flying-fox is Australia's only endemic flying-fox and occurs in the coastal belt from Rockhampton in central Queensland to Melbourne in Victoria (Tidemann 1998). However, only a small proportion of this range is used at any one time, as the species selectively forages where food is available. As a result, patterns of occurrence and relative abundance within its distribution vary widely between seasons and between years. At a local scale, the species is generally present intermittently and irregularly (Eby & Lunney 2002). At a regional scale, broad trends in the distribution of plants with similar flowering and fruiting times support regular annual cycles of migration (Eby & Lunney 2002). Whilst Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney and Melbourne are occupied continuously (Pallin 2000, Hall 2002a, van der Ree et al. 2006), elsewhere, during spring, Grey-headed Flying-foxes are uncommon south of Nowra and widespread in other areas of their range.  The species is widespread throughout their range in summer, whilst in autumn it occupies coastal lowlands and is uncommon inland.  In winter, the species congregrates in coastal lowlands north of the Hunter Valley and is occasionally found on the south coast of NSW (associated with flowering Spotted Gum Corymbia maculata) and on the northwest slopes (generally associated with flowering White Box Eucalyptus albens or Mugga Ironbark E. sideroxylon) (NSW DECCW 2010k). The species sometimes ranges into South Australia (Hall & Richards 2000) and occasional individuals have been observed on Bass Strait islands (Tidemann 1998) and mainland Tasmania (Kempton 2010). It is infrequently found west of the Great Dividing Range (Tidemann 1998).

It is silent except for a low  kiss kiss sound made between mothers and young, or when under stress (NSW NPWS 1999).","Image":"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/ImageHandler.ashx?graphicsId=22657&maxWidth=150","Image_Author":"Viridans","Habitat":"The habitat of the Long-footed Potoroo includes temperate rainforest, riparian forest and wet sclerophyll forest (Nunan et al. 2000). It occurs at a range of elevations from around 100 m (East Gippsland) to greater than 1200 m (the Victorian Alps). The species occurs in vegetation communities with constantly moist soil. Within its range in NSW, such vegetation is restricted mainly to riparian (riverside) areas (NSW NPWS 2002b). Trees in these communities include Lilly Pilly (Acmena smithii), Messmate (Eucalyptus obliqua), Mountain Grey Gum (Eucalyptus cypellocarpa), Brown Barrel (Eucalyptus fastigata) and Blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon). Understorey plants include Forest Wire-grass (Tetrarrhena juncea), Red-fruit Saw-sedge (Gahnia sieberiana), other sedges Carex and Cyperus spp., and ferns. In Victoria it always occurs in or near (usually within 250 m of) damp forest types (Jones 1998; Jones & Johnson 1997).The species needs dense cover to provide shelter and protection from predators. During the day, the Long-footed Potoroo nests beneath ferns, grass or sedge tussocks, or fallen timber (Jones & Johnson 1997; Lewis & Thulin 1995; Triggs 1998). One nest was made of bracken and coarse grass, lined with fine grass and Long-footed Potoroo hair (Jones & Johnson 1997). The species appears to prefer a sheltered aspect, a mixed species overstorey and a dense understorey for both resting and foraging (Nunan et al. 2000). One study, based on trapping records, found that Long-footed Potoroos use cool moist gullies more often during drier times of the year (spring and summer), avoiding drier ridges and slopes (Scotts & Seebeck 1989). A later study using trapping and radio-tracking in the same area found that they use both gullies and slopes, and more captures were on upper slopes, perhaps because they used more of the open vegetation after introduced predators were controlled (Green et al. 1998).","Australian_Distribution":"The Long-footed Potoroo occurs in Victoria and NSW in the following locations:Populations of the Long-footed Potoroo in Victoria    <ul>  East Gippsland, north-east of Orbost, in the catchments of the Brodribb River, Bemm River, Rodger River and Yalmy River. This population is bounded by the Rodger River, Mount Ellery, the McKenzie River, and Pinnak Road. Based on part of a skull found in a predator scat, there may be a separate population around 45 km further east near Mount Drummer, east of the Cann River (Claridge 2002; NSW NPWS 2002b; VDSE 2003).     .

The chest and belly is paler and in some individuals there is a white blaze on the chest. There is a white to buff cheek stripe and a black dorsal stripe from the forehead to the back of the head. The exterior of the ears is black, and inside the ears is buff. There is a black auxiliary patch often extending as a dark stripe to the margin of the hind-legs. There is a pale grey side-stripe sometimes present. The feet and paws are dark brown to black. The tail darkens distally with a prominent brush. The pelage is long and thick, particularly about the rump, flanks and base of the tail. Individuals from the north of the species' range tend to be lighter and have a less prominent tail brush (Eldridge & Close 1998).Males grow to 529 -586 mm and females to 510 -570 mm in head and body length. The tail length of the male is 510-700 mm and 500-630 mm for females. Males reach a weight of 5.5 -10.9 kg and females a weight of 4.9 -8.2 kg (Eldridge & Close 1998).Rock-wallabies are highly agile animals that are able to move swiftly by means of highly precise bounds through rugged and precipitous areas. The agility has been attributed to their long flexible tail used for balance and their short, flexible, well-padded, rough-textured feet which provide traction (Sharman & Maynes 1983).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/90/Petrogale_penicillata_6.jpg/440px-Petrogale_penicillata_6.jpg","Image_Author":"Doug Beckers","Habitat":"This species prefers rocky habitats, including loose boulder-piles, rocky outcrops, steep rocky slopes, cliffs, gorges and isolated rock stacks (Murray et al. 2008; Short 1982). It also utilises tree limbs (Maxwell et al. 1996; Sharman & Maynes 1983). While it appears that most Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby colonies are on north-facing slopes and cliff lines (Short 1982), colonies have been found on south-facing cliffs in Kangaroo Valley (Kutzner & Dodd 1996; Wong 1997), in the Macleay River Gorge (Bayne 1994), in the Warrumbungles and at Mt Kaputar (Soderquist undated, pers. comm., cited in NSW NPWS 2003a), although usually in lower densities.","Australian_Distribution":"The Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby was once widespread and abundant in southeastern Australia. It was formerly found along the Great Dividing Range from Nanango in south-east Queensland through to east Gippsland in Victoria (Connolly 1995; Eldridge & Close 1992; Short & Milkovits 1990). However, there has been a reduction in the species' range and numbers with the decline being greatest in Victoria and southern NSW (DEC 2005c) and the last confirmed sighting of this species in the ACT was at Wallaby Rocks in Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve in 1959 (Ormay 1996). Despite this range contraction, the Brush-tailed Rock-wallaby is still the most widespread Petrogale in eastern Australia (Eldridge & Close 1992). The species is known from 962 nationally-recorded sites; 876 of these sites are in NSW (DEC 2005c).In this profile, the term 'population' is used to describe a subset of individuals of the species occupying a defined area and potentially interbreeding. It is extremely rare for animals from different populations to exchange individuals or interbreed, so populations can be readily identified genetically. For example, there is a distinct population of Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies in the Warrumbungle National Park in NSW, 150 km from the nearest surviving population at Narrabri (NSW NPWS 2003a). Genetically separate populations of Brush-tailed Rock Wallabies can be much closer together than this; a remnant population at Taralga in NSW is distinct from one at Wombeyan Caves, only 14 km away (Eldridge et al. 2004). Within a population, the term 'colony' describes an aggregation of individuals in a patch of suitable habitat, surrounded by unoccupied habitat. For example, within the Warrumbungle National Park population, there are seven colonies, each containing around seven individual wallabies. Two colonies each occur on a discrete hill, and five occur on sections of long cliff-lines (NSW NPWS 2003a). A colony might use 800 m of cliff, or around 35 ha (Hazlitt et al. 2004). Each discrete colony is susceptible to local extinction and recolonisation through dispersal of new animals from other nearby colonies. Colonies of Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies may be subdivided into even smaller family units (Hazlitt et al. 2004).ACT A captive population is being managed at Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve (ACT), however the species is presumed to be extinct in the wild (Ormay 1996). Findings of Rock-wallaby bones and evidence of the species in predator scats along the Orroral Ridge in Namadgi National Park may suggest a more recent occurrence of the species (Reside & Martin 1996) but no records have been made. The nearest known extant populations to the ACT occur at Taralga (136 km north-northeast of Canberra) and in Kangaroo Valley (187 km east-northeast of Canberra) (ACT Government 1999b).NSW Surveys in 1993 located 47 existing colonies, in central, southern and western regions of NSW, most of which also constituted isolated populations. In the northeastern region, most Brush-tailed Rock-Wallabies were in one of three main populations; one consisting of more than 50 colonies in the Macleay Gorges system, one consisting of more than 20 colonies on the Cataract River, and one consisting of more than 20 colonies on the Clarence River (Dovey et al. 1997). Altogether, Dovey and colleagues (1997) identified 100 colonies in the north-eastern region of NSW. A survey of the species in 1995 located 15 colonies within one population in Yengo National Park and the Parr State Recreation Area (Rummery et al. 1995).  Brush-tailed Rock-Wallaby populations in northern NSW are less fragmented than in southern NSW. For example, colonies along the Apsley-Macleay River and the Clarence River (where most of the Brush-tailed Rock-wallabies in NSW occur) form near-continuous populations (DEC 2005c). The species is now absent from the western slopes and plains of NSW except for the population in the Warrumbungle National Park (Maxwell et al. 1996; NSW NPWS 2003a).","Longitude":148.2,"Latitude":-37.1},{"Scientific_Name":"Onychogalea fraenata","Common_Name":"Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby, Bridled Nailtail Wallaby","Threatened_Status":"Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":239,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=239","Family":"Macropodidae","Genus":"Onychogalea","Species":"fraenata","Description":"The Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby is a highly solitary, medium-sized macropod; up to 1 m tall and weighing up to 8 kg (males).

They shelter beneath shrubs, in large grass tussocks, and inside hollow logs. Adults prefer logs where available (Fisher & Goldizen 2001) but also used grass shelters as the biomass of grass increases after a drought, enabling them to shelter closer to feeding areas. They generally choose shelter sites with the densest cover of foliage and stems at Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby height (25-50 cm), and this type of shelter is concentrated at the edges of wooded areas such as Brigalow regrowth (Fisher 2000). At night (when they are feeding), they prefer the ecotone habitat containing both pasture and young Brigalow regrowth (Evans 1996). When feeding in open pasture, they prefer to stay close to the edge of shelter habitat (Evans 1996).

When feeding in open pasture, they prefer to stay close to the edge of shelter habitat (Evans 1996). On the north western section of Taunton National Park (Scientific), the Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby is found in all four of the major vegetation types; open grassy eucalypt woodland dominated by Poplar Box (Eucalyptus populnea), dense Acacia forest dominated by Brigalow, transitional vegetation intermediate between the woodland and forest, and in areas of very dense Brigalow regrowth (Tierney 1985). After clearing, Brigalow grows back from root stock, forming dense thickets. Older Brigalow regrowth has sparse foliage in the 0-1 m height range, but has a closed canopy above this height. Younger regrowth forms patches of small dense bushes, obscuring visibility below 1 m. At Idalia National Park, reintroduced Bridled Nail-tail Wallabies use open woodland as well as Brigalow regrowth, and also use Wilga bushes (Geijera parviflora) as shelter habitat (Veldman 1998 cited in Pople et al. 2001). Bridled Nail-tail Wallabies prefer vegetation edges: in the mid 1980s, they were most likely to occur in a narrow band of vegetation at the interface between dense Acacia scrub and open grassy eucalypt woodland in the north west of the Park (Tierney 1985). In the mid 1990s when the Brigalow regrowth in the north east of the Park had reached 2-3 m in height, they preferred the area where Brigalow regrowth abuts pasture there, and the area where rosewood (Acacia rhodoxylon) and Eucalypt woodland borders open alluvial flats in the centre of the Park. In both areas, the feeding ranges of many wallabies are concentrated at former cattle yards, where food is plentiful due to the fertile soil (Fisher 2000).","Australian_Distribution":"The\u00c2\u00a0Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby is confined to Taunton National Park (Scientific) (an area of 11 000 ha) near the town of Dingo with some sightings within 10 km of the park (Davidson 1991; Lundie-Jenkins 2001). Population genetics and radio-tracking studies have shown that the populations at different localities within Taunton National Park (Scientific) are not isolated, but connected through frequent juvenile dispersal (Fisher 1999a). One reintroduced population is confined to a smaller section of Idalia National Park in Western Queensland (Pople et al. 2001), and another exists at Avocet Nature Refuge near Emerald, in Central Queensland (Lundie-Jenkins & Lowry 2005). Another population has been re-introduced\u00c2\u00a0at Scotia Sanctuary (64 000 ha), 150 km south of Broken Hill (Finlayson et al. 2008).There was a captive population of the Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby at Pallarenda near Townsville between 1991 and 2004. There is currently a captive population at David Fleay Wildlife Park in Queensland (Johnson 1997; Lundie-Jenkins & Lowry 2005), and at Western Plains Zoo, Taronga Zoo, Scotia Sanctuary, and Genaren Hill Sanctuary in New South Wales (Lundie-Jenkins 2001; Lundie-Jenkins & Lowry 2005).At the time of European settlement, Bridled Nail-tail Wallabies were abundant in eastern Australia to the west of the Great Dividing Range. Reports by naturalists Gilbert (reported in Gould 1863), Gould (1863)and Collet (1887 cited in Gordon and Lawrie 1980) indicate that in the mid-nineteenth century, the species ranged from the Murray River region of north-western Victoria (possibly into eastern South Australia), through central New South Wales, and north to Charters Towers in Queensland (Evans & Gordon 1995). The species' range declined dramatically around 1900, and there were no confirmed sightings reported during the period 1937-1973 (Lundie-Jenkins 2001).

In its mountain habitat, this species could only be mistaken for a House Mouse, but its larger size, part furry and coiled tail, 5 (not 4) front toes, and joined (syndactyl) second and third back toes should be enough to distinguish it.","Image":"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/ImageHandler.ashx?graphicsId=43328&maxWidth=150","Image_Author":"Linda Broome, OEH","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":147.15,"Latitude":-36.98},{"Scientific_Name":"Gymnobelideus leadbeateri","Common_Name":"Leadbeater's Possum","Threatened_Status":"Critically Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":273,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=273","Family":"Petauridae","Genus":"Gymnobelideus","Species":"leadbeateri","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Leadbeater%27s_Possum_02_Pengo.jpg/440px-Leadbeater%27s_Possum_02_Pengo.jpg","Image_Author":"Pengo","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":146.1833,"Latitude":-37.8333},{"Scientific_Name":"Chaeropus ecaudatus","Common_Name":"Pig-footed Bandicoot, Kanjilpa, Wilalya","Threatened_Status":"Extinct","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":297,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=297","Family":"Peramelidae","Genus":"Chaeropus","Species":"ecaudatus","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/PigFootedBandicoot.jpg/440px-PigFootedBandicoot.jpg","Image_Author":"John Gould","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":141.33,"Latitude":-36.82},{"Scientific_Name":"Phascogale calura","Common_Name":"Red-tailed Phascogale, Red-tailed Wambenger, Kenngoor","Threatened_Status":"Vulnerable","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":316,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=316","Family":"Dasyuridae","Genus":"Phascogale","Species":"calura","Description":"The Red-tailed Phascogale is a small, arboreal, carnivorous marsupial with ash-grey fur above and cream fur below.

Population numbers appear to be greatest in habitat that has been unburnt for 20 years or more (Kitchener 1981). A large proportion of nest sites are in highly flammable locations, such as, stands of dead Allocasuarina spp. and the skirts and stumps of live and dead grass trees (Xanthorrhoea spp.). No precise habitat information is available for the arid zone, or the southern and eastern semi-arid zone (Maxwell et al. 1996).Red-tailed Phascogales have also been recovered from a variety of habitats in the Katanning District, including woodland of Swamp Oak (Casuarina obesa) over Samphires, Mallee-Scrub and low forest of Moort (Eucalyptus platypus) (DEC 2007).The Red-tailed Phascogale prefers vegetation that is unburnt for a long  time, which provides continuous canopy cover to assist their arboreal habits. Trees need to be of a sufficient age to provide hollows for nesting in limbs or logs, and grass trees need to have ample skirts to provide cover (DEC 2007). Remnant Red-tailed Phascogale populations have predominantly survived in areas dominated by dense Rock Sheoak (Allocasuarina huegeliana) woodland associated with Wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo). Fire causes high mortality amongst resident Red-tailed Phascogales (Friend & Friend 1993) and populations do not recover for years after fire events (DEC 2007).During bush fires, Red-tailed Phascogales use tree hollows above the height of flames for protection (DEC 2007).","Australian_Distribution":"Extant populations of the Red-tailed Phascogale are restricted to remnants of native vegetation throughout the wheat belt of south-western Western Australia (Kitchener 1981). They have been recorded from as far north as Beverly (south-east of Perth). Recent surveys have extended the eastern range of the species slightly to include Fitzgerald River National Park, but several populations present in the 1970s have not been relocated (Friend 1999). Isolated reserves as small as 67 ha are able to support populations of this species (Maxwell et al. 1996).The extent of occurrence of the Red-tailed Phascogale was estimated to be 9440 km\u00c2\u00b2 based on records collected between 1995 and 2007. This was measured by constructing a minimum convex polygon around records in the south-west of Western Australia. The polygon was cropped to the coastline and all islands excluded from the estimate. Where there were less than three records to a location, the locality was buffered to 2 km and the area (km\u00c2\u00b2) of remnant vegetation and conservation estate within the buffer summed.

The adults have a dark-olive head and neck, with an iridescent gloss on the crown; the mantle and the back are paler, greyish; and the upperwings are blackish, sometimes with a greenish gloss, with a contrasting white patch at the base of the trailing edge; the uppertail is black with a greenish gloss. The face is dark-olive with a narrow, white band across the forehead and lores and a white patch on the chin and throat.

Because they are aerial, it has been stated that conventional habitat descriptions are inapplicable (Cramp 1985), but there are, nevertheless, certain preferences exhibited by the species. Although they occur over most types of habitat, they are probably recorded most often above wooded areas, including open forest and rainforest, and may also fly between trees or in clearings, below the canopy, but they are less commonly recorded flying above woodland (Higgins 1999). They also commonly occur over heathland (Cooper 1971; Learmonth 1951; McFarland 1988), but less often over treeless areas, such as grassland or swamps (Cooper 1971; Gosper 1981; Learmonth 1951). When flying above farmland, they are more often recorded above partly cleared pasture, plantations or remnant vegetation at the edge of paddocks (Emison & Porter 1978; Friend 1982; Tarburton 1993). In coastal areas, they are sometimes seen flying over sandy beaches or mudflats (Cooper 1971; Crompton 1936; Davis 1965), and often around coastal cliffs and other areas with prominent updraughts, such as ridges and sand-dunes (Cooper 1971; Dawson et al. 1991; Loyn 1980; Mitchell et al. 1996; Schulz & Kristensen 1994). They are sometimes recorded above islands well out to sea (Brandis et al. 1992; Cooper 1971; Warham 1957).","Australian_Distribution":"The White-throated Needletail is widespread in eastern and south-eastern Australia (Barrett et al. 2003; Blakers et al. 1984; Higgins 1999). In eastern Australia, it is recorded in all coastal regions of Queensland and NSW, extending inland to the western slopes of the Great Divide and occasionally onto the adjacent inland plains. Further south on the mainland, it is widespread in Victoria, though more so on and south of the Great Divide, and there are few records in western Victoria outside the Grampians and the South West. The species occurs in adjacent areas of south-eastern South Australia, where it extends west to the Yorke Peninsula and the Mount Lofty Ranges. It is widespread in Tasmania (Barrett et al. 2003; Blakers et al. 1984; Higgins 1999).

The species also seasonally occurs in box-pine (Callitris) and Boree (Acacia pendula) woodlands (Webster 1998).The Superb Parrot uses a number of habitats for different activities. Superb Parrots breed in either River Red Gum forests and woodlands or box woodlands (Webster 1998). In the Riverina Region of NSW and adjacent areas of Victoria, the Superb Parrot usually breeds in forests dominated by large mature River Red Gums, typically close to watercourses, though nests are also occasionally located in Blakely's Red Gum (E. blakelyi), Grey Box (E. microcarpa), Red Box (E. polyanthemos) and Inland Red Box (E. intertexta) (Webster 1988). In the South-west Slope Region of NSW, Superb Parrots breed in box-gum forests and woodlands dominated by River Red Gum, Blakely's Red Gum, Apple Box (E. bridgesiana), Grey Box, White Box (E. albens) and Red Box (Webster 1998).There is a positive correlation between the locations of Superb Parrot nest sites and the occurrence of extensive tracts of suitable foraging habitat (Webster 1988). In the Murray-Riverina, nest sites are usually located no further than 10 km from foraging habitat, and in the South-west Slope Region, breeding and foraging habitats may coincide at some sites, and are no further than 10 km away at other sites (Webster 1988, 1998).In the Riverina Region of NSW and adjacent areas of Victoria, the Superb Parrot forages in box eucalypt woodland, particularly that dominated by Yellow Box or Grey Box, and occasionally Black Box (E. largiflorens). In the South-west Slope Region, the species forages in box-gum woodlands dominated by White Box, Yellow Box and Blakely's Red Gum, and also in crops of wheat (Triticum aestivum) or oats (Avena sativa) (Webster 1988). Outside the breeding season, some Superb Parrots forage in scattered Boree woodlands or box-pine woodlands between the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers (Webster 1998). Because the Superb Parrots often use different habitats for different activities, the timing of their occurrence in each habitat may vary with the time of year. Between mid-January and early April, Superb Parrots do not use the River Red Gum breeding habitats on the Edward and Murrumbidgee Rivers, and their whereabouts at this time is unknown (Webster 1988). Between April and August, they inhabit forests and woodlands dominated by River Red Gum, box-gum, White Cypress Pine (Callitris glaucophylla) and Boree (Webster 1998). The Superb Parrot inhabits listed threatened habitats such as grassy Yellow Box-Red Gum woodlands listed as Endangered under the Nature Conservation Act 1980 (ACT Government 1999c) and White Box-Yellow Box-Blakely's Red Gum Grassy Woodland and Derived Native Grassland listed as Critically Endangered under the EPBC Act (NSW NPWS 2002c). These habitats are also home to several other threatened species of birds, including the Bush Stone-curlew (Burhinus grallarius), Swift Parrot (Lathamus discolor), Brown Treecreeper (Climacteris picumnus), Painted Honeyeater (Grantiella picta), Regent Honeyeater (Xanthomyza Phrygia) and Hooded Robin (Melanodryas cucullata) (ACT Government 1999c; Tzaros 2005a). Some threatened mammals such as the Squirrel Glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) and Brush-tailed Phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), also inhabit similar hollows in large trees (Gibbons & Lindenmayer 2002).","Australian_Distribution":"The Superb Parrot occurs only in south-eastern Australia. The Superb Parrot is found in NSW and northern Victoria, where it occurs on the inland slopes of the Great Divide and on adjacent plains, especially along the major river-systems; vagrants have also been recorded in southern Queensland. In NSW, it mostly occurs west of the Great Divide, where it mainly inhabits the Riverina, the South-west Slope and Southern Tableland Regions: west to Mathoura, Boorooban, Goolgowi, and east to Canberra, Yass and Cowra. Its range extends north to around Narrabri and Wee Waa in the North-west Plain Region, from a line joining Coonabarabran and Narrabri, and extending at least as far west as Tottenham and Quambone, with occasional records even further west. In Victoria, the Superb Parrot is confined to the north of the State, with records mainly around Barmah State Forest/State Park, with occasional records near Strathmerton, in the Killawarra State Forest and near Mooroopna. The species has recently been recorded in southern Queensland near Eulo and also between Warwick and Goondiwindi. The breeding range of the Superb Parrot is divided into three main areas: the first, along the Murray and Edward Rivers; the second, along the Murrumbidgee River; and the third, in a triangle bounded by Molong, Yass and Young (Barrett et al. 2003; Birds Australia n.d.; Christie 2004; Davidson & Chambers 1991; Higgins 1999; Webster 1988; Webster & Ahern 1992). The extent of occurrence of the Superb Parrot is estimated, with high reliability, to be 81 000 km\u00c2\u00b2 (Garnett & Crowley 2000). The area of occupancy of the Superb Parrot is estimated at 1000 km\u00c2\u00b2. However, this estimate is considered to be of low reliability (Garnett & Crowley 2000).

They are occasionally seen on terrestrial saline wetlands near the coast, such as lakes, lagoons, pools and pans, and recorded on sewage ponds and saltworks, but rarely use freshwater swamps. They rarely use inland lakes or swamps (Higgins & Davies 1996).Habitat for refuge About a day after a cyclone had passed through Broome, lower than expected numbers (no birds) were seen in Roebuck Bay. Birds presumably moved to sheltered areas to avoid the high winds and heavy rain (Jessop & Collins 2000).Habitat for feeding The Red Knot usually forage in soft substrate near the edge of water on intertidal mudflats or sandflats exposed by low tide. At high tide the may feed at nearby lakes, sewage ponds and floodwaters (Higgins & Davies 1996). They have also been recorded foraging on beds of eelgrass on tidal sandflats (Battley, P. in Higgins & Davies 1996), on a thick algal mat in shallow water (Dann 1983), and in shallow pools on crest of coral reef (Domm & Recher 1973).Habitat for roostingThe Red Knot roosts on sandy beaches, spits and islets, and mudflats; also in shallow saline ponds of saltworks. In New Zealand they are known to roost on short wet pastures near the coast (Higgins & Davies 1996). They have been seen roosting on an inland claypan near Roebuck Bay, north-west Western Australia (Collins et al. 2001). They like to roost in open areas far away from potential cover for predators, but close to feeding grounds (Rogers 2001). In hot conditions, waders prefer to roost where a damp substrate lowers the local temperature (Rogers 1999b).","Australian_Distribution":"The Red Knot is common in all the main suitable habitats around the coast of Australia (Barrett et al. 2002b;  Minton, C.D.T. 2002, pers. comm.; Watkins 1993), but is less numerous in south-west Australia than elsewhere (Lane 1987). Very large numbers are regularly recorded in north-west Australia, with 80 Mile Beach and Roebuck Bay being particular strongholds. The only places it is not found in significant numbers are the northern part of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia and Western Australia, and along much of the NSW coast, where wader habitat is rather scarce (excluding the Hunter Estuary). It is also relatively absent west of Warranbool, Victoria through to the Coorong, South Australia. A flock, sometimes in the hundreds, is regularly recorded at Albany, south-west Western Australia (Minton, C.D.T. 2002, pers. comm.). It is occasionally recorded inland in all regions. In Queensland, the Red Knot migrates along the coast north of 19 \u00c2\u00b0S, sometimes in large numbers; it is widespread along the coast south of Townsville and along the coasts of NSW and Victoria. There are few records between Bermagui and Lakes Entrance, and from west Bellarine Peninsula to Warrnambool. It is a regular visitor to the coasts of Tasmania, and King and Flinders Islands, in small numbers. In South Australia, the species is found mostly from The Coorong, north and west to the Yorke Peninsula and Port Pirie. In Western Australia there are scattered records in the south, and it is occasionally seen around Peron Peninsula and Carnarvon. It is widespread on the coast from Ningaloo and Barrow Island to the south-west Kimberley Division. In the Northern Territory it is mainly recorded from Darwin, but also seen at various other sites. It is also recorded at Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island, Macquarie Island, Kermadec Island, Chatham Island, Auckland Island and Campbell Island (Higgins & Davies 1996).Australian sites of international importance, and there populations are listed below Bamford et al. 2008):","Longitude":null,"Latitude":null},{"Scientific_Name":"Calidris ferruginea","Common_Name":"Curlew Sandpiper","Threatened_Status":"Critically Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":856,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Aves","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=856","Family":"Scolopacidae","Genus":"Calidris","Species":"ferruginea","Description":"The Curlew Sandpiper is a small, slim sandpiper 18 -23 cm long and weighing 57 g, with a wingspan of 38 -41 cm.

The bird has noticeable breeding, non-breeding and juvenile plumages (Higgins & Davies 1996).<strong>Breeding plumage</strong>When breeding, the head and neck feathers are blackish-brown in the centre, giving a streaked pattern over a whitish background. The cap is dark, supercillum (area above eye) poorly marked and lores (area below eye) are white above with a diffuse area of brown. The chin, throat, belly, vent area and underwing are white; breast and flanks are white with a central band of black at each feather end forming an almost solid black centre to the breast. The flanks and undertail can show heart-shaped black spots. The back is blackish-brown with pale grey tips. Across the scapular feathers, central feathers have large chestnut ovals forming a chestnut band across the wings when folded. Covert feathers over primary wing feathers are grey with dark streaks and whitish fringes.

They are occasionally found on exposed reefs or rock platforms, shorelines with mangrove vegetation, ponds in saltworks, at swamps near the coast, saltlakes and non-tidal lagoons. The Great Knot rarely occurs on inland lakes and swamps (Higgins & Davies 1996). Typically, the Great Knot roosts in large groups in open areas, often at the waters edge or in shallow water close to feeding grounds (Higgins & Davies 1996; Rogers 2001). It is known that in hot conditions, waders prefer to roost where a damp substrate lowers the local temperature (Rogers 1999b). A group of approximately 8610 birds have been recorded roosting at an inland claypan near Roebuck Bay in north-west Western Australia (Collins et al. 2001). Europe: The Great Knot breeds in alpine and sub-alpine vegetation in north-east Siberia and the far north-east of Russia.

As with other members of the legless lizard family, Striped Legless Lizards lack forelimbs and have only very reduced hind limbs. These hind limbs are apparent only as small flaps on either side of the vent. Superficially, these animals resemble snakes, but can be readily distinguished from the latter by the presence of external ear openings, a fleshy undivided tongue and a tail which is longer than the body (Cogger 1992). Striped Legless Lizards can be readily distinguished from other legless lizards by body colouration, body size and head scalation.The Striped Legless Lizard is a pale-grey lizard up to 30 cm in length, with a maximum snout-vent length (SVL) of about 12 cm. Striped Legless Lizards have a long thin body and the tail, when unbroken, is about twice the length of the body. They have a series of stripes on their sides and the sides of their back, becoming diagonal bands on the tail (Cogger 1992; Wilson & Knowles 1988). These stripes are dark-brown or blackish and extend the whole length of the individual from the neck to the tail. Each stripe has individual black-centered scales. However, in some individuals, particularly juveniles, these stripes may be very faint or absent. The head is generally darker than the body, tending to black in juveniles. The underside of Striped Legless Lizards is whitish and they have a blunt snout (Cogger 2000). The sexes of Striped Legless Lizards appear very similar externally. However, adult males may be distinguished by the presence of a small rounded 'spur' under each hind limb flap (M.A. Rauhala 1998, pers. comm.).There is significant variation in the size of Striped Legless Lizards in different populations in Victoria. A study at Dashwood found the modal size class to be 6.0 -6.9 g, while a study at Derrimut Grassland Reserve reported the modal size class to be 3.0 -4.1 g (Coulson 1990; Kutt 1992). The modal size class of Striped Legless Lizards captured at the Keilor Plains site was 6.0 -6.9 g. Some generations (size classes) appeared to be uncommon, suggesting that recruitment may be low in some years (O'Shea 1996). Observations of captive animals suggest that Striped Legless Lizards may skip reproduction when not in prime condition (J. Birkett n.d., pers. comm., cited in O'Shea 1996).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Striped_legless_lizard.jpg/440px-Striped_legless_lizard.jpg","Image_Author":"Benjamint444","Habitat":"The Striped Legless Lizard is a grassland specialist. Potential habitat for the Striped Legless Lizard includes all areas which have, or once had, native grasslands or grassy woodlands (including derived grasslands) across the historical range of the speices, provided that area retains suitable tussock structure, the soil is of appropriate type and structure, and the site has not had major disturbance such as ploughing (Coulson 1990; Dorrough & Ash 1999; Hadden 1995; O'Shea 1996). All occupied sites have a grassy ground cover, often with a mixture of native and exotic perennial and annual species of tussock-forming grasses (often >20\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009350% cover) (Dorrough 1995). Until recently, this species was thought to inhabit only native grasslands dominated by species such as Spear Grass (Stipa bigeniculata) and Kangaroo Grass (Themeda triandra) (Cogger et al. 1993; Coulson 1995). However, the species is now known to occur in some areas dominated by introduced species such as Phalaris aquatica, Serated Tussock (Nasella trichotoma) and Hypocharis radicata(Corrigan et al. 1996; Coulson 1990; Hadden 1995; Kukolic 1994; O'Shea 1996; Rauhala 1996; Rauhala et al. 1995), and at sites with a history of grazing and pasture improvement (Coulson 1995; Dorrough 1995; Smith & Robertson 1999). It is not known if grassland dominated by introduced species can support Striped Legless Lizard populations in the long term, but there is evidence that they do reproduce in these habitats (Corrigan et al. 1996; Rauhala et al. 1995).","Australian_Distribution":"Distribution: The Striped Legless Lizard was formerly distributed throughout temperate lowland grasslands in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the south-western slopes and southern tablelands of New South Wales (NSW), central and southern Victoria, and the south-eastern corner of South Australia (SA) (Cogger et al. 1993). The distribution of the species has declined, with many known sites no longer supporting populations (Smith & Robertson 1999). Due to habitat fragmentation the remaining populations are probably small and isolated (Webster et al. 2003). In NSW, the species occurs at sites near Goulburn, Yass, Queanbeyan, Cooma and Tumut areas (Coulson 1995; OEH 2014ax). The formerly continuous distribution in the ACT has been reduced to four discrete areas: Gungahlin, the lower Majura Valley (including the suburb of Lawson), the lower Jerrabomberra Valley and Yarramundi Reach (Coulson 1995; Dorrough 1995; McElhinney 2002). The population at Yarramundi Reach may have become extinct (ACT Government 2005a). The range of the Striped Legless Lizard in Victoria appears to have contracted to the southern part of the state (Cogger et al. 1993), with extant populations known from the outer western and northern suburbs of Melbourne, near Cressy in the western district, Derrimut Grasslands Reserve, Dashwood (Cogger et al. 1993; Coulson 1995; Webster et al. 2003; Smith & Robertson 1999; Whitby 1995), Merton, Alexandra, Molesworth and Yea (Anon. 2002a). The species was recently recorded on the new section of the Calder Highway from Kyneton to Ravenswood (Victoria). The species is no longer found in the inner metropolitan areas of Melbourne (Cogger et al. 1993). The species was believed to be extinct in SA in 1993 (Cogger et al. 1993). However populations have been discovered in recent years at Lake Omerod and Hack's Lagoon Conservation Park, near Naracoorte (S. Milne 2001a, pers. comm.). An additional sighting on Kyby-Jesse Road in this area may have indicated an additional population. However, this site has since been destroyed (Milne 1999).","Longitude":144.92,"Latitude":-37.77},{"Scientific_Name":"Aprasia parapulchella","Common_Name":"Pink-tailed Worm-lizard, Pink-tailed Legless Lizard","Threatened_Status":"Vulnerable","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":1665,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1665","Family":"Pygopodidae","Genus":"Aprasia","Species":"parapulchella","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Pink-tailed_Worm-lizard_%28Aprasia_parapulchella%29_%289105308465%29.jpg/440px-Pink-tailed_Worm-lizard_%28Aprasia_parapulchella%29_%289105308465%29.jpg","Image_Author":"Matt","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":144.3,"Latitude":-36.8},{"Scientific_Name":"Caretta caretta","Common_Name":"Loggerhead Turtle","Threatened_Status":"Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":1763,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1763","Family":"Cheloniidae","Genus":"Caretta","Species":"caretta","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Loggerhead_sea_turtle.jpg/1600px-Loggerhead_sea_turtle.jpg","Image_Author":"Ukanda","Habitat":"In Australia, Loggerhead Turtles nest on open, sandy beaches (Spotila 2004). Hatchlings enter the open ocean and begin feeding on small animals. Small Loggerhead Turtles live at or near the surface of the ocean and move with the ocean currents. In eastern Australia, there is evidence that they spend around 15 years or more in the open ocean (M. Chaloupka pers. comm. cited in Bjorndal et al. 2000), with much of their feeding in the top 5 m of water (Spotila 2004), before recruiting to their chosen inshore or neritic feeding area. Loggerhead Turtles choose a wide variety of tidal and sub-tidal habitat as feeding areas (Limpus 2008a). Loggerhead Turtles show fidelity to both their foraging and breeding areas (Limpus 2008a).

It is known from waters all around Australia (Robins et al. 2002) and can be found foraging year round in Australian waters (Limpus in Hamann et al. 2006) over Australian continental shelf waters. Adults feed mainly on pelagic soft-bodied creatures such as jellyfish and tunicates (Bone 1998; Cogger 1992), which occur in greatest concentrations at the surface in areas of upwelling or convergence. The regular appearance of Leatherback Turtles in cool temperate waters is probably due to the seasonal occurrence of large numbers of jellyfish. Leatherback Turtles require sandy beaches to nest, with some evidence that coarser sand is more conducive to successful hatching than finer sand (Limpus et al. 1984). Sand temperatures between 24\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009334 \u00c2\u00a1C are needed for successful incubation (Limpus et al. 1984).

The frog also has a distinct tympanum (ear membrane) (Cogger 2000).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Litoria_aurea_green2.jpg","Image_Author":"LiquidGhoul","Habitat":"Green and Golden Bell Frogs have been found in differing habitat in NSW and Victoria. In NSW, the species commonly occupies disturbed habitats, and breeds largely in ephemeral ponds (Pyke & White 1996). However, in Victoria, the Green and Golden Bell Frog occupies habitats with little human disturbance and commonly breeds in permanent ponds, as well as ephemeral ponds (Pyke & White 1996). Goldingay (1996) argued that this is because most natural habitats are degraded or lost in NSW (Gillespie 1996).","Australian_Distribution":"The Green and Golden Bell Frog occurs mainly along coastal lowland areas of eastern NSW and Victoria. The most northern extent of the species distribution is from Yuraygir National Park (NP) near Grafton on the North Coast of NSW (White & Pyke 2008) while the most southern extent of the species' distribution is in the vicinity of Lake Wellington, just west of Lakes Entrance in south-eastern Victoria (Gillespie 1996). The furthest inland record of the species is at a recently discovered population near Hoskinstown in the Southern Tablelands (referred to as the Molongolo population) (Osborne et al. 2008). The species was previously known from elsewhere in the Southern Tablelands, but is now considered to have disappeared from the ACT (Osborne 1990) and central slopes around Bathurst (NSW DEC 2005e).","Longitude":148.53,"Latitude":-37.8},{"Scientific_Name":"Philoria frosti","Common_Name":"Baw Baw Frog","Threatened_Status":"Critically Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":1934,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Amphibia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1934","Family":"Myobatrachidae","Genus":"Philoria","Species":"frosti","Description":"The Baw Baw Frog grows to 45 mm.

Soils are generally sand and clay loams that are often gravelly or stony and always well drained (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995). It does not occur in the Basalt Land systems (Victorian Workshop Participants 2000).Victoria :In Victoria, the Crimson Spider-orchid occurs in Box-Ironbark open forests, usually consisting of Long-leaved box (Eucalyptus goniocalyx), Red Stringybark (E. macrorhyncha), Red Box (E. polyanthemos), Red Ironbark (E. sideroxylon), on well drained, gravelly or stony sand and clay loam. The understorey typically consists of scattered heathy shrubs and grasses such as Fringed Brachyloma (Brachyloma ciliatum), Handsome Flat-pea (Platylobium formosum), Parrot-pea (Dillwynia phylicoides), Erect Guinea-flower (Hibbertia riparia), and Red Anther Wallaby-grass (Joycea pallida) (Coates 2003c).NSW :The habitat for the single known population of the Crimson Spider-orchid is regrowth woodland on granite ridge country in the Nail Can Hill Crown Reserve outside of Albury. Clearing took place in this reserve in the early part of the century but despite a history of grazing and burning, the regenerating woodland has retained a high diversity of plant species. The dominant trees of the woodland are Blakely's Red Gum (Eucalyptus blakelyi), Red Stringybark, Red Box and White Box (E. albens). The understorey is made up of a variety of shrubs, herbs and grasses including: Native Cherry (Exocarpos cupressiformis), Silver Wattle (Acacia dealbata), Hickory Wattle (A. implexa), Mountain Grevillea (Grevillea alpina), Austral Indigo (Indigofera australis), Hop Bitter-pea (Daviesia latifolia), Showy Parrot-pea (Dillwynia sericea), Common Beard-heath (Leucopogon virgatus), Slender Rice-flower (Pimelea linifolia), Purple Coral-pea (Hardenbergia violacea), Spreading Flax-lily (Dianella revoluta), Many-flowered Mat-rush (Lomandra multiflora), Kangaroo Grass (Themeda australis), Snow Grass (Poa sieberiana) and Wallaby Grasses (Austrodanthonia spp.) (NSW NPWS 2003q).Bethungra and Burrinjuck populations:The Crimson Spider-orchid is also found in woodland which is broadly similar to the above. Dominant tree species are: Blakely's Red Gum, Red Stringybark, White Box. Red Ironbark and Tumbledown Red Gum/Dwyer's Red Gum (Eucalyptus dealbata and E. dwyeri) may also be present. Understorey species at this site include: Hickory Wattle, Varnish Wattle (Acacia verniciflua), Spreading Wattle (A. genistifolia), Native Cherry (Exocarpos cupressiformis), Violet Kunzea (Kunzea parvifolia), Native Box (Bursaria spinosa), Sticky Hop-bush (Dodonaea viscosa), Peach Heath (Lissanthe strigosa), Common Fringe-myrtle (Calytrix tetragona), Austral Indigo (Indigofera australis), Cunningham's Bush-pea (Pultenaea cunninghamii), Daphne Heath (Brachyloma daphnoides), Purple Coral-pea (Hardenbergia violacea), Ivy Goodenia (Goodenia hederacea), Nodding Blue Lily (Stypandra glauca), Creamy Candles (Stackhousia monogyna) and Bluebell (Wahlenbergia sp.) (NSW NPWS 2003q). The two areas at Burrinjuck Nature Reserve for which records of the Burrinjuck population exist support somewhat different natural vegetation communities. The population along the road occurs in an Open Forest dominated by several Eucalypt species including: Long-leaved Box (Eucalyptus goniocalyx), Broad-leaved Peppermint (Eucalyptus dives), Brittle Gum (E. mannifera) and Scribbly Gum (E. rossii). The understorey is dominated by the shrubs Dogwood (Cassinia aculeata), Sticky Hopbush and Waxy Wattle (Acacia caesiella); and the ground layer contains Handsome Flat-pea (Platylobium formosum), Cunningham's Bush-pea, Rock Fern (Cheilanthes austrotenuifolia) and Snow Grass (Poa sieberiana). Further up the ridge where the second population occurs this community grades into a Tall Open Forest in which the tree species Broad-leaved Peppermint, Long-leaved Box and Red Stringybark predominate. The understorey here includes: Rusty Wattle (A. rubida), Grey-leaved Hibbertia (Hibbertia obtusifolia), Bidgee-widgee (Acaena novaezelandiae), Twining Glycine (Glycine clandestina), Starwort (Stellaria pungens) and Snow Grass (NSW NPWS 2003q).","Australian_Distribution":"Past Distribution:Historically, the Crimson Spider-orchid was found in north-eastern and southern central Victoria and southern NSW.\u00c2\u00a0Specifically,\u00c2\u00a0it was scattered across central and eastern parts of the goldfields between Albury and the Loddon River (Coates et al. 2002).:Current Distribution:Victoria The Crimson Spider-orchid occurs in the Beechworth and Chiltern areas of Victoria within the Victorian Northern Inland Slopes Bioregion. Additional populations are thought to occur in the Central Victorian Uplands Bioregion in the Broadford/Tyaak area (Coates 2003c). The species is reported from Stanley and Chiltern, however these populations are taxonomically uncertain.Records from the Goldfields Region in the Bendigo and Castlemaine areas are unconfirmed (Coates 2003c) and records from western (west of Wangaratta) Victoria are the Elegant Spider-orchid (Caladenia formosa) (Victorian Workshop Participants 2000).New South Wales (NSW)The Crimson Spider-orchid is confined to granite ridge country in the Nail Can Hill Crown Reserve near Albury (where the species was originally described), and from a small Crown land site north-west of Wagga Wagga (NSW NPWS 2003q). Anecdotal evidence from local residents suggests that the species was previously much more common in the Albury area. It may be, however, that the main concentration of the species was in different habitat to that of currently known sites. Areas in the vicinity of Albury, and also Tabletop Mountain, Yambla Range (north of Albury), may also support populations and further survey work is required (NSW NPWS 2003q). The NSW Scientific Committee listing (NSW Scientific Committee 1997b)\u00c2\u00a0also incorporates two populations which have each been described as separate species by Jones: Bethungra and Burrinjuck populations (Wheeler 2011\u00c2\u00a0pers. comm.).The Bethungra population comprises a few hundred plants in a very restricted area, less than half a hectare, in three small subpopulations on private property near Bethungra (Briggs 2011 pers. comm.). The area of Crown Land and private property in the vicinity of this site is poorly known and further survey work in the area could yield additional populations of the species and a better understanding of its habitat requirements.

Soils generally have a sandy component being either sand or loamy sand but Clover Glycine has also been found on clay soils (Davies 1986; Lynch 1994b; Tas DPI 2003). Soils with Clover Glycine populations in Tasmania are generally well draining, however the associated soils in South Australia are reported to have water retaining capacity (Davies 1986; Lynch 1994b; Tas DPI 2003).In Tasmania, sites are often flat with well draining loose sandy soils or with a dolerite substrate (Lynch 1994b; Tas DPI 2003). Lynch (1994b) carried out detailed habitat and species association studies of Tasmanian Clover Glycine populations (Table 2).

In Tasmania, Clover Glycine has been found in the Botanical Districts of Central Highlands, Ben Lomond, North East and East Coast (CHAH 2008a). There are also records of Clover Glycine extending up into the lower section of the Southern Tableland Botanical District in NSW (CHAH 2008a).The extent of occurrence is calculated at 351 350 km\u00c2\u00b2, based on Australia's Virtual Herbarium (CHAH 2008a) data. The estimate is considered to be of low reliability, as recent ground truthing (on-site surveying to check remote sensing data) has not occurred at all populations.The area of occupancy is estimated at 131 km\u00c2\u00b2, based on the number of 1 km\u00c2\u00b2 grid squares in which the species is thought to occur. The estimate is considered to be of low reliability, as recent ground truthing has not occurred at all populations.This species may be naturally fragmented with populations possibly rare and patchy across Tasmania prior to European arrival (Vic DSE 2005).Determining location counts for Clover Glycine was not possible as at 2008. Environment and Biodiversity Services (EBS) (2006) suggests searching for further sites as a recovery strategy for Clover Glycine. Lynch (1994b) has raised concerns that Clover Glycine populations may have been overestimated in Tasmania through incorrect identification. Clover Glycine is hard to locate and generally only detectable when in flower or fruit (Lynch 1994b; Tas DPI 2003). Historically, Australia's Virtual Herbarium (CHAH 2008a) data shows locations within highly urbanised areas of Melbourne. Attempting to relocate locations of Clover Glycine based on herbarium records has led researchers to sites of urban development (Brown 2008, pers. comm.). Current Australian Virtual Herbarium data has approximately 200 herbarium records for Clover Glycine although some of these are collected at the same location (CHAH 2008a).Meredith and Richardson (1986) indicated that populations of Clover Glycine have been kept at the Botanic Gardens of Adelaide in South Australia and the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens in Hobart. Clover Glycine has also been grown for studies and experimental trials at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) (Davies 1986; Grant et al. 1984).This species may be naturally fragmented with populations possibly rare and patchy across Tasmania prior to European arrival (Vic DSE 2005).With the available information it is not possible to calculate the generation length of Clover Glycine.

Greenhood orchids share other characteristics such as; they grow in the ground; have fleshy tubers which are replaced each year; have a rosette of leaves which they shed each year; and are pollinated by male fungus gnats and mosquitoes (insects of the families Mycetophilidae and Culicidae respectively) (Bishop 1996).The Leafy Greenhood is distinctive amongst the Greenhood orchids because of its large fleshy leaves that are typically in a loose rosette surrounding the stem and large flowers (30 -40 mm long) with bright reddish-brown colourations in the sinus and hood (Jones et al. 1999).Floral StructuresLeafy Greenhoods produce a single, semi-nodding greenhood up to 40 mm long and 12 -15 mm wide (Bramwells 1993). This hood is translucent white with green stripes on top (the dorsal sepal), whilst the sides of the hoods (petals) are a reddish-chocolate brown. The lower part of the flower resembles a fork-like structure due to a deep notch between the chocolate brown lateral sepals (Jones 1998d).Distinctive features of this species' flower include that the hood is erect for &#190; of its length and then curves forward (downward) in a semicircle and ends in a blunt point (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995; Jones et al. 1999) and that the modified petal (labellum) appears as a short brown tongue within the hood (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995). In the related species  P. sp. aff.  cucullata (Barrington Tops) the top of the hood is horizontal and does not curve downward like the Leafy Greenhood, and has a broader, more strongly curved labellum (Bishop 1996).Vegetative CharactersThe Leafy Greenhood has a thick, basal rosette of three to seven fleshy dark green leaves that can appear cabbage-like (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995; Jones et al. 1999). In Tasmania, the leaves have also been recorded growing up the stem (Jones et al. 1999). Plants are deciduous and become dormant during summer (Dell & Bester 2006).Tubers of Leafy Greenhoods from Mornington Peninsula populations can grow up to 19 mm and produce replacement tubers each year, irrespective of whether the plant has produced leaves during that season (Mawson pers comm., as cited in Dell & Bester 2006). Leafy Greenhoods from Mornington Peninsula have shown that there is a relationship between tuber size and re-shooting/flowering time, with larger tubers shooting earlier (Dell & Bester 2006).","Image":"https://data.rbg.vic.gov.au/cip/preview/image/library/124617?maxsize=1024","Image_Author":"Jeff Jeanes ","Habitat":"The Leafy Greenhood occurs in two distinct habitat types that correspond with the two distinct forms (sub-species) of Leafy Greenhood; one that occurs in coastal environments and the other in montane/inland environments.Coastal Habitat:The coastal form of the Leafy Greenhood is usually found in protected areas of stabilized coastal sand dunes under open to closed scrub dominated by Coast Tea-tree (Leptospermum laevigatum), and/or Moonah (Melaleuca lanceolata), with an open ground stratum.

The species was known to occur in stony or rocky areas on the volcanic plains south-west of Melbourne (Nevill & Camilleri 2010). It was also found on low granite hills and mountains, including Mount Emu, Mount Cole, Mount Langi Ghiran and Mount Buangor in western Victoria. In Tasmania the species is presumed extinct, however it was reported from dry, stony sites and banks of streams (Curtis & Morris 1975).Habitat at Mount Alexander:The Southern Shepherd's Purse appears to have very specific and finely balanced habitat requirements. At Mount Alexander, the species occurs on gently to steeply sloping granite rockplates, usually with an easterly or south-westerly aspect. It grows on seasonally moist moss mats on a shallow soil layer and occasionally growing directly in shallow soil pockets. It is not found on moss mats that utilize deeper soils (Alexander 2004). Sites in which it occurs are usually open, containing only light canopy cover from surrounding trees including the Manna Gum, Eucalyptus viminalis, and Messmate Stringybark, Eucalyptus oblique. The habitat is classified as Granitic Hills Woodland Ecological Vegetation (Nevill & Camilleri 2010). Southern Shepherd's Purse shares this moss mat habitat with a diversity of other indigenous annual and geophytic vascular plants which are typical of seasonally moist or rocky sites in central and northern Victoria. The most dominant of these species is Breutelia affinis, with other common species including Bartramia papillata, Bryum billardeiri, Campylopus introflexus, Grimmia pulvinata, and Polytrichum juniperinum.

The soils range from clay to loamy sand (Davies 2000d; DEH 2007).In Victoria, Large-fruit Fireweed occurs most commonly in grasslands on red-brown earth soils. It may also occur in grassy woodlands and open woodlands (Hills & Boekel 2003).In NSW, Large-fruit Fireweed occurs in partly cleared dry forests and box-gum woodlands which transition to Brittle Gum Forest with a relatively undisturbed understorey of native grasses, forbs and subshrubs (Fallding 2002; R. Rehwinkel 2008, pers. comm.).In South Australia, at Messent Conservation Park the following vegetation associations were noted (Davies 1992a, 1995b, 2000d; Owens et. al. 1995):\r<ul>\r81% of Large-fruit Fireweed was found in Leptocarpus brownii, Baumea juncea closed sedgeland with Lepidiosperma concavum, Schoenus nitens and Tetraria capillaris..\r12.8% of Large-fruit Fireweed was found in Gahnia filum, Samolus repens herbland with Podolepis canescens, Wilsonia rotundifolia and W. backhousei..\r5.9% of Large-fruit Fireweedwas found in a Banksia ornata shrubland with or without emergent Eucalyptus incrassata with Eucalyptus diversifolia, E. fasciculosa, Lepidiosperma concavum, Pultenaea tenuifolia and Thomasia petalocalyx..\r</ul>\rIn Messent Conservation Park it was noted that no plants were recorded from either Eucalyptus diversifolia open mallee or Melaleuca brevifolia low shrubland (Cutten & Squire 2002). The soils consist of loamy sands that are light grey when dry and dark grey when wet, and pH 8. There is scattered calcrete on the surrounding ridges (Davies 1986, 1992a, 1995b, 2000d). The elevation for 94% of Large-fruit Fireweed sites was between 9\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009313 m above sea level with < 1% found below this elevation (Cutten & Squire 2002).At Gum Lagoon Conservation Park, Large-fruit Fireweed occurs in a Melaleuca brevifolia low shrubland on clay soil in a broad depression that is subject to seasonal waterlogging. Searches of this vegetation type elsewhere in the park failed to find any more plants (Davies 2006d). Davies (2000d) suggests that Large-fruit Fireweed is occurring as a successional species after a disturbance event but is now being out matured by the Melaleuca.At Yalkiri Station, Large-fruit Fireweed occurs in a low sparse-shrubland dominated by Lasiopetalum behrii and Correa alba var. pannosa with an absent ground stratum. The plants occur in loamy sand in solution holes in sheet limestone on an undulating plain (Kraehenbuehl 1993, pers. comm. cited in Davies 2000d)At Tarcowie in the southern Flinders Rangers, Large-fruit Fireweed plants occur in an Eucalyptus camaldulensis woodland (Davies 1999, pers. obs. cited in Davies 2000d).At Daley Head on the Yorke Peninsula, South Australia, the species occurs in a Gahnia filum sedgeland surrounded by scattered Melaleuca lanceolata and M. halmaturorum (Murfet & Taplin 1994, pers. comm. cited in Davies 2000d).In Victoria, Large-fruit Fireweed occurs predominantly in the Western (Basalt) Plains grassland on red brown earth soils found on recent Quaternary (basalt) deposits where it is the subdominant species along with Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides. It also occurs in grassy woodlands such as Grey Box Open Woodland (on Tertiary sediments) and Long-leaved Box Open Woodland (on Silurian sediments and Quaternary deposits) (Scarlett n.d., pers. comm. cited in Hills & Boekel 2003).In NSW, Large-fruit Fireweed occurs beside a creek in a Box-Gum Woodland that is transitioning into a partly cleared Brittle Gum Forest with a groundlayer of relatively undisturbed and highly diverse native grasses, forbs and sub shrubs (Fallding 2002; R. Rehwinkel 2008, pers. comm.).A part of the Large-fruit Fireweed habitat, the Western (Basalt) Plains Grassland Community, in Victoria, has been listed as threatened under schedule 2 of the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 (Victoria) and an action statement has been published (Craigie & Moorrees 2003).Large-fruit Fireweed is associated with the following EPBC Act listed species (Cutten & Squire 2002; Davies 1995b; Mainprize 2003; Owens et. al. 1995; Pearce & Hollow 2002):<ul>Metallic Sun-orchid (Thelymitra epipactoides) - Endangered.Spiral Sun orchid (Thelymitra matthewsii) - Vulnerable.Olearia pannosa ssp. pannosa - Vulnerable.Button Wrinklewort (Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides) - Endangered .Small Milkwort (Comesperma polygaloides) - Vulnerable. .</ul>Furthermore, Large-fruit Fireweed is associated with Purple Eyebright (Euphrasia collinia ssp. collina) a plant of significance at the Deep Lead Flora and Fauna Reserve (Hills & Boekel 2003).","Australian_Distribution":"Large-fruit Fireweed was previously a widespread species occurring from the Yorke Peninsula in the west of South Australia, across to Victoria in an area bounded by Wimmera in the north to the Melbourne district in the east (Davies 1986). It also previously occurred in the north-east of Tasmania (Belcher 1983).Large-fruit Fireweed is currently distributed as one very large population in Messent Conservation Park in South Australia and small populations at Daly Head on the Yorke Peninsula and Yalkiri Station, Tarcowie Parklands and Gum Lagoon Conservation Park, South Australia (Lawrence & Davies 2006). In Victoria the species range has contracted to areas around Melbourne and Ararat (S. Sinclair 2008, pers. comm.). One population has been discovered near Gundaroo in NSW (D. Taylor 2008, pers. comm.; Thompson 2004) and the species is now considered extinct in Tasmania.Extent of occurrence:The current extent of occurrence is calculated at 3000 km\u00c2\u00b2. This figure is based on Australian Virtual Herbarium data. The estimate is considered to be of low reliability as recent ground-truthing has not occurred (Australian National Herbarium 2008).The past extent of occurrence is calculated at 5006 km\u00c2\u00b2 (Australian National Herbarium 2008).Studies in Messent Conservation Park, South Australia, have indicated population stablity over the period 1992 until 2006 (Lawrence & Davies 2006). There is no data available for the rest of the populations which are much smaller in size (S. Sinclair 2008, pers. comm.).Area of occupancy:The current area of occupancy is estimated at 43 km\u00c2\u00b2. These figures are based on the number of 1 km\u00c2\u00b2 grid squares in which the species is thought to occur. The estimate is considered to be of low reliability as recent ground-truthing has not occurred (Australian National Herbarium 2008).The past area of occupancy is estimated at 58 km\u00c2\u00b2 (Australian National Herbarium 2008).The area of occupancy of populations in Messent Conservation Park should remain stable as long as external conditions do not change. Studies have indicated that the level of individuals in this area have remained stable from 1992 until 2006 (Lawrence & Davies 2006). There is concern for other populations due to their small population size and threats (S. Sinclair 2008, pers. comm.).Large-fruit Fireweed currently occurs in 17 locations (Davies 2000d; DEH 2007; Hills & Boekel 2003; Thompson 2004).Large-fruit Fireweed is not known to be cultivated in South Australia (Davies 1986). The La Trobe University and the Organ Pipes National Parks in Victoria maintain a seed store for Large-fruit Fireweed (Hills & Boekel 2003) and the La Trobe University has plants in cultivation (Davies 1992a; Meredith & Richardson 1986).In Victoria, Large-fruit Fireweed has been reintroduced into Organ Pipes National Park, Laverton North Grassland Reserve, Derrimut Grassland Reserve and Clare and Scobie Mackinnon Nature Reserve (Hills & Boekel 2003). A study was undertaken on the re-introduction of Large-fruit Fireweed into the following three reserves; Laverton North Grassland Reserve (introduction started in 1983), Organ Pipes National Park (introduction started in 1985) and Mooramong Nature Reserve (introduction started in 1985), and the plants were monitored until 1997. This study provided analysis of the decline in number of plants and populations at the reserves (Morgan 1999b).A separate study was undertaken on the re-introduction of Large-fruit Fireweed into Organ Pipes National Park in 1990, and the plants were monitored until 2003. This study does not indicate numbers of plants or populations and there is no indication of whether they are using the introductions from the previous study or they introduced more plants. The results from this study indicate that the Large-fruit Fireweed population did not decline, but was a large and stable population (McDougall & Morgan 2005).In South Australia, apart from 35 000 plants in Messent Conservation Reserve, there are only 4 locations with no more than 20 plants and usually less than 10 plants in each. Two of these sites are in conservation reserves (Davies 2000d).The occurrence of Large-fruit Fireweed in Victoria is even more fragmented. Most of the locations occur in small, disjunct remnants of vegetation ranging from 6 m\u00c2\u00b2 to 3 ha (Hills & Boekel 2003) and range from 2\u00e2\u0080\u0093200 plants (S. Sinclair 2008, pers. comm.). Seven of the 16 locations occur on rail reserves, which are susceptible to disturbance and damage from line works, traffic, fire and weed invasion. Two of the rail sites at Laverton and Sunbury have been destroyed.","Longitude":144.4167,"Latitude":-37.95},{"Scientific_Name":"Westringia cremnophila","Common_Name":"Snowy River Westringia","Threatened_Status":"Vulnerable","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":16458,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=16458","Family":"Lamiaceae","Genus":"Westringia","Species":"cremnophila","Description":null,"Image":"https://data.rbg.vic.gov.au/cip/preview/image/library/84897?maxsize=512","Image_Author":"Neville Walsh","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":148.3461111111,"Latitude":-37.2877777778},{"Scientific_Name":"Lepidium hyssopifolium","Common_Name":"Basalt Pepper-cress, Peppercress, Rubble Pepper-cress, Pepperweed","Threatened_Status":"Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":16542,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=16542","Family":"Brassicaceae","Genus":"Lepidium","Species":"hyssopifolium","Description":"The Basalt Pepper-cress is an erect, multi-branched perennial herb that grows up to 1 m in height, with stems and stem leaves covered in fine short needle-shaped hairs (Leigh et al. 1984; Tumino 2010).

Basal leaves are toothed or pinnately lobed and stem leaves linear-lanceolate, toothed or entire and grow to 1-4 cm in length and 1-3 mm in width (Tumino 2010). The inflorescence (flower cluster) is borne on a raceme (an unbranched inflorescence made up of flowers each on a short stalk), and the flowers themselves are very small, greenish in colour and inconspiculous. Sepals are 0.8 mm long, and petals are either reduced or absent. There are, however, two stamens.

Recently recorded localities have predominantly been in weed-infested areas of heavy modification, high degradation and high soil disturbance such as road and rail verges, on the fringes of developed agricultural land or within small reserves in agricultural land. Many populations are now generally found amongst exotic pasture grasses and beneath exotic trees such as the Radiata Pine (Pinus radiata) and Monterey Cypress (Cupressus macrocarpus), often associated with other species of Lepidium (Ayers et al. 1996; MEL collection records; Tumino 2010).

The Australian subspecies breeds and roosts on two islands off NSW, Cabbage Tree and Boondelbah Islands, and the at-sea distribution is poorly known (NSW 2006a; D'Ombrain 1970; Fullagar 1976; Hindwood & Serventy 1941; Hull 1911b; Priddel & Carlile 1995b, 1997; Priddel et al. 1995).The breeding colonies on Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island are in the transitional zone between the subtropical (with maximum summer rainfall) and temperate climatic zones (with maximum winter rainfall) (NPWS 2003). On Cabbage Tree Island, Gould's Petrels mostly breed among rocky scree and beneath coarse woody debris in gullies dominated by dense rainforest, heavily vegetated with Cabbage Tree Palms (Livistonia australis), figs (Ficus) and Native Plums (Planchonella australis) (NSW 2006b; D'Ombrain 1970; Fullagar 1976; Hindwood & Serventy 1941; Hull 1911b; Priddel & Carlile 1995b, 1997; Priddel et al. 1995), but also occasionally among tussocks of mat-rush (Lomandra longifolia) (D'Ombrain 1970). Nests occur from just above sea level to elevations of 120 m (Fullagar 1976).","Australian_Distribution":"The Australian subspecies of the Gould's Petrel breeds in NSW on Cabbage Tree Island and nearby Boondelbah Island, near Port Stephens (Fullagar 1976; Priddel & Carlile 1997, 1997a), and at least one pair on Montague Island, near Naroooma (ABC News 2013). The pelagic distribution of Gould's Petrel is unknown, as when they are seen at sea, they are indistinguishable from the New Caledonian subspecies (Pterodroma leucoptera caledonica) (Marchant & Higgins 1990).","Longitude":141.23,"Latitude":-38.22},{"Scientific_Name":"Galaxias fuscus","Common_Name":"Barred Galaxias","Threatened_Status":"Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":26168,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Actinopterygii","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=26168","Family":"Galaxiidae","Genus":"Galaxias","Species":"fuscus","Description":"The barred galaxias is a reddish brown fish growing to 15 cm long, but commonly reaches 7-9 cm long.

It has small dark irregular spots or bars extending onto lower sides and the base of the dorsal and caudal fins, few or absent markings on the head and dusky grey to brownish fins with white or creamy margins (sometimes tinged with orange or yellow) (Allen 1989a; McDowall 1996).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/FMIB_45643_Oligorus_macquariensis.jpeg/440px-FMIB_45643_Oligorus_macquariensis.jpeg","Image_Author":"Edgar Ravenswood Waite","Habitat":"Recent research in the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers show that Trout Cod occupy stream positions characterised by a high abundance of large woody debris (or 'snags') in water that is comparatively deep and close to riverbanks. However, midstream snags are also an important habitat component (NSW Fisheries 2001).In the Murray River below Yarrawonga Weir, Trout Cod inhabit a large (60\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0094100 m wide), deep (>3 m) flowing river section with a sand, silt and clay substrate that contains abundant snags and woody debris. Trout Cod are often angled from within, under or adjacent to snags, branch piles, and steep clay banks, usually in areas of relatively fast current (Douglas et al. 1994). In a study by Brown and colleagues (1998), Trout Cod were only found in snag piles that were typically opposite sandy beaches or on outside bends. There is a degree of overlap with the habitat requirements of Murray Cod and therefore competition between these two species is likely (Brown et al. 1998). As a large proportion of the streams that the Trout Cod originally inhabited are now degraded, it is difficult to accurately determine the habitat requirements of the species (Reed 1995). Several authors (Cadwallader & Backhouse 1983; Lake 1971; Llewellyn & MacDonald 1980) believe Trout Cod to be more common in the cooler waters of the upper reaches of streams.Seven Creeks (Victoria) is a relatively narrow stream (5\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u00947 m wide) with shallow (<2 m) pools interspersed by rapids and cascades (up to 4 m in height) (Douglas et al. 1994). Here, the species occurs in fast-flowing water over bedrock, boulder and sand-gravel substrates. Larger fish occur in deep holes between falls and rapids while the smaller fish shelter beneath and amongst boulders. Juveniles have been found in pools in a steep rocky section of the Seven Creeks system (Cadwallader & Backhouse 1983). In Seven Creeks, partitioning of habitat use was evident with adults utilising pools and smaller juveniles utilising the riffle complexes (areas of a stream or river characterised by a rocky substrate and turbulent, fast-moving, shallow water) (NSW DPI 2006).A Trout Cod radio tracking study has been conducted in a 40 km reach of the Murray River, downstream of Lake Mulwala (Koehn & Nicol 2014). This river in this region is a \"large, lowland river situated on low-gradient riverine plains, with low energy, and is characterised by meandering bends. The species was strongly associated with structural woody habitat (>68% cover), deeper (>2.4 m), slower water (<0.2 m s<sup>-1</sup>) closer to the river bank. Murray Cod and Trout Cod were found in deeper and faster water, and deeper in the water column, than other tracked species (Golden Perch (Macquaria ambigua) and Carp (Cyprinus carpio)). The species only uses a small proportion of habitat, and is strongly influenced by the presence of structural woody debris (Koehn & Nicol 2014).","Australian_Distribution":"The Trout Cod is known from a single natural population, two stable translocated populations and many stocked populations. All stocked sites require continued stocking and there is only limited evidence that some stocked populations are self sustaining (NSW DPI n.d.).Natural Population:The natural distribution of Trout Cod has declined since European settlement. The single naturally occurring population is restricted to a small (approximately 120 km) stretch of the Murray River from below Yarrawonga Weir to Strathmerton (Douglas et al. 1994; NSW Fisheries 2001; Rimmer 1987), but is occasionally taken downstream as far as the Barmah State Forest (McKinnon 1993) and further downstream to Gunbower (Douglas et al. 2012). Unconfirmed records have also been made further downstream from near Murrabit, Swan Hill and near Tooleybuc (Douglas et al. 2012).Translocated Populations:The Trout Cod was been\u00c2\u00a0introduced between 1921 and 1922\u00c2\u00a0to\u00c2\u00a0Seven Creeks (a tributary of the Goulburn River) in Victoria (Cadwallader & Backhouse 1983; Ingram & Richardson 1989; Ingram et al. 1990). The population\u00c2\u00a0now occurs upstream of Euroa between Gooram Falls and Polly McQuinns Weir (Reed 1995), for a distance of about 8 km (Douglas et al. 1994).The Trout Cod was introduced prior to 1918 to Cataract Dam in coastal NSW (outside the species range). The population is thought to have hybridised with Murray Cod (M. peelii peelii) (Douglas et al. 1994;\u00c2\u00a0Gehrke & Harris 1996; Rimmer 1988). Trout Cod from the Ovens River were introduced into Lake Sambell (an artificial lake at Beechworth, Victoria) in 1928 and the species was common here until an unexplained fish kill in the 1970s (Berra & Weatherley 1972; Cadwallader & Backhouse 1983).Stocked Populations:Since the mid 1980s both\u00c2\u00a0the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and the Victorian\u00c2\u00a0DPI have been operating a breeding and conservation stocking program for the Trout Cod. This program has resulted in Trout Cod being stocked at numerous sites throughout their former distribution in the Murray-Darling River system of Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Between 1986 and 2005, over one million Trout Cod (826 000 from Narrandera Fisheries Centre in NSW and the remainder from Snob's Creek Hatchery in Victoria), were released as fingerlings or juveniles into a range of selected sites (Harris & Rowland 1996; NSW DPI 2005).Stocking sites include the Murray, Murrumbidgee, Macquarie and Abercrombie River catchments in NSW; the Goulburn, Ovens, Broken, Coliban and Mitta Mitta River catchments in Victoria; and the Murrumbidgee River catchment in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT Government 1999a; Brown et al. 1998; Douglas et al. 1994; Faragher et al. 1993).In NSW, stocked populations occur in the upper Murray River above the Hume Dam, upper Murrumbidgee River between Adaminaby and Murrells Crossing, near Cooma, middle sections of the Murrumbidgee River from Burrinjuck to Yanco Weir, the Macquarie River near Dubbo and Talbingo Dam in the Kosciusko National Park. The primary stocking sites in NSW include Angle Crossing, Wantabadgery, Collingullie, Narrandera and Yanco in the Murrumbidgee River system and Namina Falls and Devils Elbow in the Macquarie River System. To date, recruitment of stocked populations has been detected in the Murrumbidgee River at Angle Crossing and Narrandera (Gilligan 2005).Historic Distribution:Trout Cod were once widespread throughout the southern tributaries of the Murray-Darling system, including tributaries of the Murray River in Victoria, the Murrumbidgee (including upland tributaries in the ACT), and the upper half of the Macquarie River (NSW DPI 2005). In 1971, Lake (1971) noted that the species was extremely rare upstream of the Murray River at Yarrawonga, where it has been common 20 years before. Except for the first officially reported Trout Cod and one other unconfirmed report, there have been no further documented reports of Trout Cod occurring naturally in the Macquarie River system. Trout Cod have never been recorded in the Lachlan River (Douglas et al. 1994), however they must have occurred historically in this system as their distribution includes both neighbouring rivers to the north and south (NSW DPI 2005).","Longitude":144.25,"Latitude":-36.72},{"Scientific_Name":"Nannoperca obscura","Common_Name":"Yarra Pygmy Perch","Threatened_Status":"Vulnerable","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":26177,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Actinopterygii","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=26177","Family":"Percichthyidae","Genus":"Nannoperca","Species":"obscura","Description":"The Yarra Pygmy Perch is a dusky, pale, brownish-grey, sometimes greenish fish with a pale belly, spots along the midline, and clear, faint yellow to black fins.

It grows to 15 cm tall and flowers in spring and summer (Sinclair 2010). After flowering it dries out to rootstock (Sinclair 2010). The flowerheads are 2-5 cm in diameter and surrounded by numerous white overlapping ovate-oblong bracts, with the outer layer often tinged purple or brown (Sinclair 2010).The stems are branched and woody near the base or can be erect with the older stems spreading horizontally. The young stems are white with woolly hairs. The stems grow 10-40 cm long (Curtis 1963; Tas. DPIPWE 2003a). The leaves are stalkless, between 4-12 cm long and arranged alternately on the stem. They are crowded near the base of the stem and threadlike to almost flat with margins that are bent backwards. Both surfaces are covered in soft cotton like hairs that are white. The older leaves are persistent at the base of the stems (Curtis 1963; Tas. DPIPWE 2003a).The flower heads are solitary and at the ends of long stalks that bear a few small, scattered bracts (leaf-like structures). The outer phyllaries (bracts of the flower) are shorter than the inner ones, oblong shaped and very thin and clear. The inner phyllaries are between 18-20 mm long and have narrow-oval thin blades, which are white or tipped with reddish purple. The florets contain both sexes. The second whorl of floral leaves is greenish-yellow and shorter than the phyllaries. Flowering occurs in November-January (Curtis 1963; Tas. DPIPWE 2003a).The fruits are brown, ovoid, 2-3 mm long, with 14-20 pappus bristles (Wilson 1992a). The fruit is a small, dry structure with leathery walls. The fruit is hairless and the pappus (ring of scales or hairs found at the top of the fruit) is not joined at the base, rather it is slightly thickened towards the tip and feather-like (Curtis 1963; Tas.

Plants can be found in natural or semi-natural vegetation and grazed or ungrazed habitat. Bare ground is required for germination. The unpalatability of this species is likely to protect it in heavily grazed areas where patches of bare ground are likely to develop, favouring recruitment (Gilfedder & Kirkpatrick 1994d, 1994e). Tasmania: In Tasmania, the Hoary Sunray has a broad climatic and ecological range, occurring in temperate grassy habitats on clay loam soils (Gilfedder 1991a; Gilfedder & Kirkpatrick 1994d, 1994e). Sites range from 60\u00c3\u00901160 m altitude, with annual rainfall varying from 450 mm in the midlands to 2000 mm (occasionally 3000 mm) in the north-west (Sinclair 2010). There is a considerable area of potentially suitable habitat for Hoary Sunray in Tasmania (Gilfedder & Kirkpatrick 1994d). The species occurs in eight of the grassland and grassy woodland communities described for Tasmania (Gilfedder & Kirkpatrick 1994d). The largest populations of Hoary Sunray occur on gentle slopes on fertile clay-loam soils associated with limestone. It is absent from the low fertility soils derived from quartzite and conglomerate that are widespread in western Tasmania (Gilfedder & Kirkpatrick 1994d).

The head is short and blunt with large eyes, while the mouth is small, terminal and oblique, with jaws roughly equal in length. The dorsal and anal fins are opposite, shortbased and rounded. The caudal fin is long and rounded, with fleshy flanges extending forward almost to the bases of the dorsal and anal fins.

Wetlands connected to a more permanent waterbody (such as river or creek) may also be vital to their long-term survival (particularly during extended dry conditions) and must therefore be considered as part of the habitat requirement critical to survival (Saddlier et al. 2010).","Australian_Distribution":"The Eastern Dwarf Galaxias has been recorded from southern Victoria, Flinders Island (Bass Strait), north-east Tasmania (Andrews 1976), north-west Tasmania (Chilcott & Humphries 1996), and south-east South Australia (SA) (McDowall 1980a).\u00c2\u00a0On the mainland, it occurs from the Mitchell River Basin in central Gippsland, Victoria, to the Cortina Lakes, near the Coorong in South Australia.

The males and females appear different. The male has a bright yellow head and neck, which grades through yellow-olive on the hindneck to dark olive-green on the mantle and scapulars; the scapulars are also mottled blackish; the back and rump are bright yellow; and the uppertail is blue-black. The upperwings are mostly blue-black, with a prominent yellow shoulder-patch and red feathers on the inner secondary coverts and tertials; in flight, the red secondary coverts appear as a red band. The underbody is bright yellow except for the undertail, which is black. The underwings are bright yellow, contrasting with blackish flight feathers. The female has a similar pattern of plumage to the male, but appears duller: the head, neck and underparts are dull olive-green instead of bright yellow; the tail and flight feathers are dull bluish-green instead of blue-black; the shoulder-patch is duller greenish yellow; and the red markings on the wings are duller; and the underwings appear lime green instead of bright yellow (Higgins 1999).The Regent Parrot is usually seen in pairs or small flocks, but much larger flocks may congregate around abundant sources of food (Bedggood 1958; Morgan 1917; Sullivan 1967). During breeding season, when females are busy incubating the eggs, males may form single-sex flocks (Beardsell 1985; Keartland 1903; Tarr 1964).

Nearby open mallee woodland or shrubland, usually with a ground cover of spinifex (Triodia) or other grasses, supporting various eucalypts, especially Christmas Mallee (E. socialis) and Yellow Mallee (E. costata) Mallee, as well as Belah (Allocasuarina cristata), Buloke (A. leuhmannii) or Slender Cypress Pine (Callitris preissii) also provide important habitat for this subspecies. They often occur in farmland, especially if the farmland supports remnant patches of woodland along roadsides or in paddocks.  The subspecies seldom occurs in more extensively cleared areas (Beardsell 1985; Burbidge 1985; Emison et al. 1987; Webster 1991).Breeding habitatNests are most often located in River Red Gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), and occasionally in Black Box (E. largiflorens), usually within 16 m of permanent water, or sometimes actually standing in water. Nest sites may sometimes occur near temporary water sources, such as ephemeral streams or seasonal billabongs, but these are usually within about 60 to 100 m of permanent water sites (Beardsell 1985; Burbidge 1985; Webster 1993; Webster & Leslie 1998). Nest trees are typically large (>150 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) and approximately 30 m tall) (Sluiter et al. 2007). Generally, about one-third of nests are in dead trees, but there is much variation between sites and between years (Burbidge 1985). In South Australia, this subspecies mainly nests in dead trees (Higgins 1999) but is also known to have nested in holes in cliffs along the Murray River (Campbell 1900; Ross & Howe 1930). Many breeding colonies, assumed to be traditional nesting sites, are in areas that have become drowned as a result lock and weir construction on the Murray River, although it is likely that birds have continued to nest at these sites in trees that are now dead (Higgins 1999; Smith 2001). There is a positive association between the position of Regent Parrot (eastern) nest sites and the presence of large nearby stands of mallee vegetation. The proximity of major nest sites to large stands of mallee (within 20 km, though usually 5 to 10 km) reflects the dependence of the Regent Parrot (eastern) on mallee vegetation as a feeding habitat during the breeding season (Burbidge 1985). During the breeding season, this subspecies makes two to three return trips each day between breeding sites in River Red Gums and foraging sites in mallee woodland (Burbidge 1985; Forshaw & Cooper 2002).","Australian_Distribution":"The Regent Parrot (eastern) is confined to the semi-arid interior of southeastern mainland Australia.","Longitude":145.0,"Latitude":-37.25},{"Scientific_Name":"Eucalyptus alligatrix subsp. limaensis","Common_Name":"Lima Stringybark","Threatened_Status":"Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":64340,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=64340","Family":"Myrtaceae","Genus":"Eucalyptus","Species":"alligatrix","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Eucalyptus_alligatrix_Gardenology.org-IMG_9342_rbgm10dec.jpg/220px-Eucalyptus_alligatrix_Gardenology.org-IMG_9342_rbgm10dec.jpg","Image_Author":"Raffi Kojian","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":145.99219,"Latitude":-36.74897},{"Scientific_Name":"Diomedea amsterdamensis","Common_Name":"Amsterdam Albatross","Threatened_Status":"Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":64405,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Aves","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=64405","Family":"Diomedeidae","Genus":"Diomedea","Species":"amsterdamensis","Description":"The Amsterdam albatross or Amsterdam Island albatross,[2] Diomedea amsterdamensis, is a huge albatross which breeds only on Amsterdam Island in the southern Indian Ocean.

The Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross has been observed over waters of surface-temperature 10\u00c2\u00a1 to 23\u00c2\u00a1C, but is most abundant over the warmer parts of the subtropical zone (Biermann & Voous 1950; Brown et al. 1975; Cooke & Mills 1972).  In breeding and non-breeding seasons, the species concentrates over the productive waters of continental shelves, often at coastal upwellings and the boundaries of currents (Brown et al. 1975; Cooke & Mills 1972; Weimerskirch et al. 1985). Birds breeding south of the Subtropical Convergence may be pelagic and travel far to subtropical feeding grounds (Weimerskirch et al. 1986). In the Australasian region, the species occupies inshore and offshore waters (Latham 1980; Storr 1964; Swanson 1983), particularly where there are calm seas and light winds (Cox 1973; Storr 1964). The birds fly low or at medium heights over the sea, using air currents rising off swells for lift (Marchant & Higgins 1990). The Indian Yellow-nosed Albatross breeds on islands of the southern Indian Ocean. The southern limit of breeding may be determined by the distance to subtropical waters used for feeding (Weimerskirch et al. 1986). The species nests on tussock-covered coastal cliffs and slopes, often in rocky situations (Grindley 1981; Weimerskirch et al. 1986).

Leaves are grey-green, dull crimson at the base, narrow and tapering, grow to 45 cm long by 12 mm wide, and are broadly V-shaped, with a prominent abaxial keel along the midrib and loose clasping leaf sheaths. Blades, sheaths and midribs usually have small, irregularly spaced teeth. Leaves are deciduous in summer if plants are water-stressed (Carter 2010d; Gray & Knight 2001).The inflorescence is erect, 20-90 cm long, with a slender, arching scape that bears several bluish, star-shaped, nodding, sweetly fragrant flowers. Perianth segments are pale to deep blue-violet, recurved, elliptic, grow to 10 mm long by 3 mm, the outer tepals with five veins, the inner tepals with three veins. There are six stamens, that grow to 7 mm long, with pale yellow filaments, orange strumae and pale lime-yellow anthers, while the style is whitish-translucent and grows to 6 mm long.

Most populations occur in remnant vegetation along roadsides, railways and in small flora and nature reserves within the urban landscape (Carter 2010d). In the northern suburbs of Melbourne, populations have been recorded at Bundoora, Eltham, Craigieburn, Reservoir, Epping and South Morang (Carter 2010d). Some plants in the South Morang area were associated with EPBC Referral 2009/5313 (SMREP 2010). Populations in rural areas include St Andrews, Yarra Glen, Traralgon (in the La Trobe Valley), Lyndhurst (near Cranbourne in Melbourne's south-east), Castlemaine and Harcourt (in central Victoria), Kyneton Rifle Range and rail reserves at Riddells Creek (Macedon Ranges Shire) (Carter 2010d). On the Victorian Volcanic Plains, there are populations between Sunbury and Bacchus Marsh as well as further west near Mortlake (Carter 2010d). There is a highly disjunct population near Omeo (Carter 2010d). Surveys for EPBC Referral 2009/4888 found this species in the vicinity of Epping Road, Wollert (Ecology Partners 2009c). In western Victoria, there may be populations near Stawell, Deep Lead Flora and Fauna Reserve and at Dadswells Bridge in the northern Grampians, although the taxonomic identity of these plants requires verification (Carter 2005).

South-western regionThe Long-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland) has been observed in open forests and the ecotones between them. Most sites were dominated by either Eucalyptus obliqua or E. baxteri. There were also E. ovata and E. viminalis however these were less common. The average tree height was approximately 20 m, however, at poorer sites the trees only reached 5 m. The soils were highly acidic clay soils with a thin layer of sand.Grampians regionThe Long-nosed Potoroos (SE Mainland) habitat in this region is dominated by heath-woodland with an abundance of Eucalyptus oblique and E. aromaphloia. E. baxteri was present in some places. The tree height ranged from 10\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009315 m with a 2 m tall shrub layer consisting of Acacia spp., Banksia marginata and Leptospermum juniperinum. The soils in this region have a leached sandy profile and are highly acidic. Otways regionIn this region its habitat is dominated by stringybark eucalypts, Eucalyptus oblique or E. baxteri. Near watercourses or poorly drained areas, E. ovata and E. viminalis were commonly found. The habitat was characterized by a dense low shrub layer of Acacia verticillata and Banksia marginata. The region had acidic sandy or sandy loam soils overlaying a variety of sub-soils. Western Port regionMost Long-nosed Potoroos (SE Mainland) in the region have been found in areas of heath-woodland or open forest. These sites are developed, relatively dry, well drained old dunes to heavier soils in low-lying areas. The regions are often flooded during the winter. Most sites contained Eucalyptus obliqua on higher sites or E. obliqua and E. viminalis in wetter areas. The trees ranged from 7\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009313 m tall. Wilsons Promontory regionMost specimens of the Long-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland) have been collected in areas of heath-woodland grading into heath. The dominant tree species are the Eucalyptus obliqua and E. baxteri. E. radiata is sometime present. The tree height ranges from 5\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009315 m with an open or sparse canopy. The soils are sandy loams overlying leached sand soils or brown gradational soils. East Gippsland regionThe Long-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland) is found in both open forest and woodland and the ecotone in-between. It is found in areas containing Eucalyptus sieberi, E. globoidea, E. muellerana, E. baxteri and E. cypellocarpa. Tree height varies from 20\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009340 m. The soils in the region are generally acidic soils and leached sand. NSW and QueenslandThe Long-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland) is sparsely distributed along the coast and Great Dividing Range of south-east Queensland through NSW (Van Dyck & Strahan 2008). There is limited information about the species habitat in Queensland and NSW. There is no consistent pattern to the habitat of the Long-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland); it can be found in wet eucalypt forests (Seebeck 1995b) to coastal heaths and scrubs (Mason 1997).

Sightings have also been reported al Lake Fyans. Otways regionFossil records and remains indicate the Long-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland) was originally distributed at Mount Hamilton, Swains Cave, Mount Porndon, Three Mile Beach, and south of Nullawarre. Modern distributions include Naringal East, Ecklin South, Glenfyne, Jancourt, Timboon, Peterborough, the Parker River inlet, Aire Valley, Turtons Track, Benwerrin, Barwon Downs, Hordern Vale, Gellibrand River, Charleys Creek, Lorne and Aireys Inlet. It has been sighted at Gervoc, Bullahaare, the Simpson Heytesbury district, Crayfish Bay, Blanket Bay and Moonlight Head.Western Port region Historical records indicate the Long-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland) occurred around Swan Lake and Philip Island. Today the species can still be found on Phillip Island as well as French Island. Wilsons Promontory regionLong-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland) specimens have been obtained from Lilly Pilly Gully, Halfway Hut, Lighthouse Road, Frazer Creek, Sealers Cove, Refuge Cove and Waterloo Bay.East Gippsland Region Historical records indicate the Long-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland) once occupied areas near Buchan, Murrindal and Mallacoota. Modern distributions are found around Bairnsdale, Nungurner, Lakes Entrance, Lake Bunga, Lake Tyers, Ewing Marsh, Bete Bolong, Corringle, Gabbage Tree, the Sydenham Inlet, Temboon Inlet, Red River, Sandpatch Point and the Mallacoota Inlet.NSW and Queensland:The Long-nosed Potoroo (SE Mainland) has scattered populations extending from south-eastern Queensland through to NSW. The species has been recorded at Many Peaks Range, south-east of Gladstone, Bellthorpe near Beerwah and in the Border Ranges (Amos 1982). It has also been seen at Bulburin, south-west of Miriam Vale (Lindenmayer & Viggers 1994) and in the Lamington National Park and surrounds (Queensland Regional NRM Groups' Collective 2013b). In NSW it has been seen at several locations (Mason 1997). The Queensland populations are considered to be reasonably secure (Amos 1982). Only one detailed study is available for NSW. The population at Tyagarah was estimated to be around 80\u00e2\u0080\u009390 and was considered to be insecure (Mason 1997).

The Grey Nurse Shark (east coast population) has been recorded as far north as Cairns (Pogonoski et al. 2002; Stevens 1999). However, more recently Grey Nurse Shark distribution in Australia has generally been confined to coastal waters off southern Queensland and along the entire NSW coast (Environment Australia 2002a). The species may be a rare vagrant in the northern section of the Commonwealth south-east marine bioregion.In NSW, aggregations of Grey Nurse Sharks (east coast population) can be found at reefs off the following locations: Byron Bay, Brooms Head, Solitary Islands, South West Rocks, Laurieton, Forster, Seal Rocks, Port Stephens, Sydney, Bateman's Bay, Narooma (Otway & Parker 2000) and Montague Island. An aggregation is considered to be five or more Grey Nurse Sharks present at the same site at the same time (Otway & Parker 2000). Known key aggregation sites for Grey Nurse Sharks (east coast population) in Queensland include sites off Moreton and Stradbroke Islands and Rainbow Beach. The above sites may play an important role in pupping and/or mating activities, as Grey Nurse Sharks (east coast population) form regular aggregations at these sites (Pollard et al. 1996). Relatively little is known about the migratory habits of Grey Nurse Sharks in Australian waters. Evidence suggests migrational movement, probably in response to water temperatures, up and down the east coast. At certain times of the year, Grey Nurse Sharks (east coast population) aggregate according to sex. Male animals predominate in southern Queensland waters during July to October, while a high proportion (77.4%) of the catch from beach meshing operations off central NSW at this same time is composed of females (Reid & Krogh 1992). Dive charter operators regularly see Grey Nurse Sharks at the same locations and these observations suggest that the species exhibits some degree of site fidelity (Pollard et al. 1996).

The inflorescences are delicate, open, up to 25 cm in length and remain partly enclosed by the upper leaf sheath until late maturity, often drying to a pale golden colour. Panicles (the separate branched cluster of flowers that form the flowerhead) detach from the plant when mature and are blown away by wind. The light green, or occasionally purple-tinged, spikelets (small spikes that form the 'flower') are 2.5 mm (Vic DPI 2011) to 4 mm in length (Murphy 2010), with the upper glume (modified leaf or scale at base of a grass spikelet) longer than the lower glume. Lemmas (outer or lower modified leaves or scales) have fine, straight, or gently curved, awns (bristle-like appendages found on the spikelets) that are 1.5-3 mm in length and are attached towards the top, being only just visible beyond the tip of the spikelet (Murphy 2010; Vic. DPI 2011).Environmental conditions and site characteristics determine the species' habit, with plants at drier sites generally smaller and with fewer inflorescences than those at moister sites. In ephemeral (not lasting) habitat, the species is an annual (dies off each year), whilst in continuous moist sites the species is perennial (lasting for many years) (Murphy 2010).","Image":"http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vroimages.nsf/Images/sip_adamsons_blown_grass/$File/adamsons_blown_grass_plants.jpg","Image_Author":"A J Brown","Habitat":"Adamson's Blown-grass is confined to slow moving creeks, swamps, flats, depressions or drainage lines (such as along roadsides) that are seasonally inundated or waterlogged and usually moderately to highly saline (Murphy 2010; Vic.

Plants appear to favour sites that have some shelter from the wind, often provided by other species such as Canary-grass (Phalaris aquatica), Juncus spp. or Gahnia spp. (Moorrees 2004). This preference for protected sites may explain why plants are rarely found around larger, more open, exposed saline lakes. The species will also tolerate some waterlogging, but will not survive in relatively deep water for any length of time (Moorrees 2004).Associated species include Streaked Arrowgrass (Triglochin striata), Plains Saltmarsh-grass (Puccinellia stricta var. perlaxa), Australian Salt-grass (Distichlis distichophylla), Common Blown-grass (Lachnagrostis filiformis), Beaded Glasswort (Sarcocornia quinqueflora), Creeping Monkey-flower (Mimulus repens), Salt Pratia (Pratia platycalyx), Creeping Brookweed (Samolus repens), Selleria (Selleria radicans) and Round-leaf Wilsonia (Wilsonia rotundifolia) (Murphy 2010).

The adult female, more colourful than the male, has a chestnut-coloured head, with white around the eye and a white crown stripe, and metallic green back and wings, barred with black and chestnut. There is a pale stripe extending from the shoulder into a V down its upper back. The adult male is similar to the female, but is smaller and duller with buff spots on the wings and without any chestnut colouring on the head, nape or throat (D. Ingwersen 2007, pers. comm.; NSW NPWS 2006).This species is generally seen singly or in pairs, or less often in small flocks (Marchant & Higgins 1993). Flocking occurs during the breeding season, when adults sometimes form loose gatherings around a group of nests. Flocks can also form after the breeding season, and at some locations small groups regularly occur. Groups comprising of a male and up to six offspring have been observed (D. Ingwersen 2007, pers. comm.; Marchant & Higgins 1993).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Australian_Painted-Snipe_female_Nov02.JPG/220px-Australian_Painted-Snipe_female_Nov02.JPG","Image_Author":"Aviceda","Habitat":"The Australian Painted Snipe generally inhabits shallow terrestrial freshwater (occasionally brackish) wetlands, including temporary and permanent lakes, swamps and claypans. They also use inundated or waterlogged grassland or saltmarsh, dams, rice crops, sewage farms and bore drains. Typical sites include those with rank emergent tussocks of grass, sedges, rushes or reeds, or samphire; often with scattered clumps of lignum Muehlenbeckia or canegrass or sometimes tea-tree (Melaleuca). The Australian Painted Snipe sometimes utilises areas that are lined with trees, or that have some scattered fallen or washed-up timber (Marchant & Higgins 1993).Australian Painted Snipe breeding habitat requirements may be quite specific: shallow wetlands with areas of bare wet mud and both upper and canopy cover nearby. Nest records are all, or nearly all, from or near small islands in freshwater wetlands (D. Rogers 2002, pers. comm.), provided that these islands are a combination of very shallow water, exposed mud, dense low cover and sometimes some tall dense cover (Rogers et al. 2005). The Australian Painted Snipe has also been recorded nesting in and near swamps, canegrass swamps, flooded areas including samphire, grazing land, among cumbungi, sedges, grasses, salt water couch (Paspalum), saltbush (Halosarcia) and grass, also in ground cover of water-buttons and grasses, at the base of tussocks and under low saltbush (Marchant & Higgins 1993). One nest has been found in the centre of a cow-pat in a clump of long grass (Marchant & Higgins 1993). The nest is usually placed in a scrape in the ground (Pringle 1987), and either has scant lining or is a shallow bowl-shaped nest of dry grass or other plant material (Marchant & Higgins 1993). The closely related Rostratula benghalensis nests on the ground, sometimes on low hummocks or mounds, normally concealed in thick marshy vegetation. They sometimes nest in more open aquatic environments e.g. on a dense mat of floating water weed. Nests are usually lined with leaves and stems, and are occasionally built up with interwoven plant material, but infrequently bare (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The Australian Painted Snipe can use modified habitats, such as low-lying woodlands converted to grazing pasture, sewage farms, dams, bores and irrigation schemes (Marchant & Higgins 1993), however they do not necessarily breed in such habitats (D. Rogers 2002, pers. comm.). The Australian Painted Snipe loafs on the ground under clumps of lignum, tea-tree and similar dense bushes (Marchant & Higgins 1993). This species has been recorded foraging under clumps of tea-trees (Leach et al. 1987) but most records are from daytime roost sites and the foraging habitat requirements of this species are not well understood and may be quite specific (D. Rogers 2002, pers. comm.).This species requires suitable wetland areas even in drought conditions. The species can move to suitable habitat if necessary (Marchant & Higgins 1993).The Australian Painted Snipe is not known to associate with any other species or subspecies of fauna or flora that are listed as threatened under the EPBC Act. ","Australian_Distribution":"The Australian Painted Snipe has been recorded at wetlands in all states of Australia (Barrett et al. 2003; Blakers et al. 1984; Hall 1910b). It is most common in eastern Australia, where it has been recorded at scattered locations throughout much of Queensland, NSW, Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. It has been recorded less frequently at a smaller number of more scattered locations farther west in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Western Australia (Barrett et al. 2003; Blakers et al. 1984; Marchant & Higgins 1993; Rogers et al. 2005). It has also been recorded on single occasions in south-eastern Tasmania (Hall 1910b) and at Lord Howe Island (NSW NPWS 1999b).The extent of occurrence of the Australian Painted Snipe is estimated, with low reliability, to be 4 500 000 km\u00c2\u00b2 (Garnett & Crowley 2000). A comparison of recent and historical records published in Rogers and colleagues (2005) provides no compelling evidence of a change in the extent of occurrence. The extent of occurrence is accordingly suspected to be stable at the present time (Garnett & Crowley 2000).The area of occupancy of the Australian Painted Snipe is estimated, with low reliability, to be 1000 km\u00c2\u00b2 (Garnett & Crowley 2000). The area of occupancy has undoubtedly declined as approximately 50% of wetlands in Australia have been removed since European settlement (Environment Australia 1997). It is difficult to pinpoint locations of decline because the Australian Painted Snipe has been recorded in recent years at scattered sites throughout much of its historical range, and is recorded only infrequently at most sites, the latter making it difficult to determine if its absence from a site is temporary or permanent (Lane & Rogers 2000; Rogers et al. 2005). A comparison of recent and historical records published in Rogers and colleagues (2005) shows that there have not been any recent records of the Australian Painted Snipe from north-western NSW, or from a number of scattered other locations from which historical records were obtained. Rogers and colleagues (2005) also state that there have been no recent records from south-central Queensland. In 2007, however, a female was observed at a nest in the Diamantina Channel country, and an unconfirmed report was received from the Longreach area in the same year (D. Ingwersen 2007, pers. comm.). The Australian Painted Snipe has also been recorded at several new locations in recent years (Rogers et al. 2005), but these are fewer in number than the locations that have seemingly been abandoned. A substantial decline in the overall reporting rate of the snipe since the 1950s, despite an increase in survey effort in recent decades, further suggests that the snipe is now less widespread than it once was (Lane & Rogers 2000; Rogers et al. 2005). In light of this evidence, the area of occupancy is suspected to be decreasing at the present time (Garnett & Crowley 2000).","Longitude":144.8,"Latitude":-37.72},{"Scientific_Name":"Psophodes leucogaster","Common_Name":"Mallee Western Whipbird","Threatened_Status":"Vulnerable","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":81025,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Aves","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=81025","Family":"Psophodidae","Genus":"Psophodes","Species":"leucogaster","Description":"The Western Whipbird (eastern) is about 20 to 25 cm long and has a mass of around 47 g (Higgins & Peter 2002).

It also occurs in thickets of Acacia (Condon 1966).The structure of the habitat appears to be more important in determining suitability than the species composition (Smith 1991b) and the frequency of wildfire has an important role in maintaining a habitat structure that is suitable for the Western Whipbird (eastern) (Baker-Gabb in prep.; Woinarski et al. 1988). The Western Whipbird (eastern) has been recorded in habitats that were last burnt less than two years earlier, and in habitats that were last burnt forty or more years ago, but most habitats that are occupied have a post-fire age of 10 to 25 years (Clarke 2005b; Higgins & Peter 2002; Woinarski et al. 1988).The Western Whipbird (eastern) is said to associate with the Red-lored Whistler (Pachycephala rufogularis) (Hunt & Kenyon 1970), which is listed as Vulnerable under the EPBC Act. It also occurs in areas inhabited by the Malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) and Regent Parrot (eastern) (Polytelis anthopeplus monarchoides) both listed as Vulnerable under the EPBC Act and the Black-eared Miner (Manorina melanotis) and Mallee Emu-wren (Stipiturus mallee)  (Baker-Gabb in prep.) listed as Endangered under the EPBC Act.","Australian_Distribution":"The Western Whipbird (eastern) occurs in three isolated regional populations in southern South Australia: the first on the southern Eyre Peninsula; the second on the south-western Yorke Peninsula; and the third in the Murray-Mallee region of south-eastern South Australia (perhaps extending across the border to western Victoria).

Australian Freshwater Molluscs. http://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/freshwater_molluscs/","Habitat":"The Glenelg Freshwater Mussel is found in shallow, narrow, flowing sections of the Crawford River with dense riparian vegetation that shade the water thus moderating water temperatures. Woody debris from the riparian vegetation that falls into streams is an important habitat feature, providing stable sediments and a refuge from strong currents (Playford & Walker 2008). The species lives in firm, coarse sandy sediments that supply ideal burrowing substrate, and allows feeding, respiratory and reproductive organs to function without clogging. The species is also reliant on flowing water as this assists in maintaining suitable water temperatures and restricting algal growth. Mussels burrow using their hard shell as a blade and a strong muscular 'foot' as an anchor, leaving only the hindmost part of their shell above the sediments. They may occur singly in marginal habitats, and in small aggregations or shoals in more favourable environments. Due to the physical attributes of the Glenelg Freshwater Mussel, it is suggested that the species favours smaller streams with less forceful water movements (Playford & Walker 2008). Water quality is an important aspect of mussel habitat. Adult Glenelg Freshwater Mussels are likely to have an upper salinity tolerance of about 4 parts per thousand, similar to other Hyriidae mussels (Walker et al. 2001). Only the Crawford River and two smaller tributaries in the Glenelg River catchment consistently have salinities below this level in the known range of this species (Playford & Walker 2008).Plant species found in riparian areas where the Glenelg Freshwater Mussel is located include Eucalyptus species, Blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon) and Woolly Tea-tree (Melaleuca lanigerum) (Playford & Walker 2008).","Australian_Distribution":"The Glenelg Freshwater Mussel\u00c2\u00a0is found only in the lower reaches of the Crawford River, a tributary of the Glenelg River, in south-west Victoria (Playford & Walker 2008).

P. striatellum, is a tufted perennial forb with leaves in basal rosettes arising from fleshy, often extensively branched rhizomes. Plants occur in clonal colonies that may be up to several metres wide. The leaf-stalks are velvety, having short glandular and non-glandular hairs in roughly equal proportions, and with occasional longer non-glandular hairs. The leaves are all or mostly basal (in a rosette), with leaves on the short stems, if present, being opposite. The rosette leaves are on leaf-stalks between 2 and 6 cm long, with leaf blades egg-shaped in outline, between 1 and 2.5 cm long and 1 to 2 cm wide. The leaves are entire or shallowly lobed; most commonly with 5 to 7 lobes and with scalloped margins. The leaf surface is minutely furry along the veins and near the edges. The flowering stems are to 15 cm tall, and terminate with an umbrella-like flower-cluster with 1 to 3 (and sometimes to 7) flowers that are borne on stalks between 1 and 2 cm long. The flowers have 5 petals that are wider at their tips than at their bases and are between 8 and 11 mm long. The flowers are in various shades of pale pink and each petal is marked with darker crimson or purple branching stripes that run down to the center of the flower. Flowers have 10 stamens. The fruit, 10 to 15 mm long, is a dry structure that splits into 5 segments. The fruit is elongated and shaped like a stork's bill, hence the plant's common name. Flowering is from October to March, with the peak flowering occurring in November and December. Seeds ripen and are shed about five weeks after flowering.","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Pelargonium_benambra.jpg/220px-Pelargonium_benambra.jpg","Image_Author":"Melburnian","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":147.6956,"Latitude":-36.9558},{"Scientific_Name":"Galaxias rostratus","Common_Name":"Flathead Galaxias, Beaked Minnow, Flat-headed Galaxias, Flat-headed Jollytail, Flat-headed Minnow","Threatened_Status":"Critically Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":84745,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Actinopterygii","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=84745","Family":"Galaxiidae","Genus":"Galaxias","Species":"rostratus","Description":null,"Image":"https://fishesofaustralia.net.au/images/image/Galaxias%20rostratus%20Tarmo%20Raadik%20alt.jpg","Image_Author":"Tarmo Raadik","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":144.936,"Latitude":-36.8306},{"Scientific_Name":"Limosa lapponica baueri","Common_Name":"Bar-tailed Godwit (baueri), Western Alaskan Bar-tailed Godwit","Threatened_Status":"Vulnerable","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":86380,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Aves","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=86380","Family":"Scolopacidae","Genus":"Limosa","Species":"lapponica","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg/220px-Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg","Image_Author":"JJ Harrison","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":145.23,"Latitude":-38.47},{"Scientific_Name":"Limosa lapponica menzbieri","Common_Name":"Northern Siberian Bar-tailed Godwit, Bar-tailed Godwit (menzbieri)","Threatened_Status":"Critically Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":86432,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Aves","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=86432","Family":"Scolopacidae","Genus":"Limosa","Species":"lapponica","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg/220px-Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg","Image_Author":"JJ Harrison","Habitat":null,"Australian_Distribution":null,"Longitude":null,"Latitude":null},{"Scientific_Name":"Commersonia prostrata","Common_Name":"Dwarf Kerrawang","Threatened_Status":"Endangered","Listed_SPRAT_TaxonID":87152,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=87152","Family":"Malvaceae","Genus":"Commersonia","Species":"prostrata","Description":"The Dwarf Kerrawang is a prostrate, mat-forming shrub with trailing branches to 2 m long and ovate to cordate leaves 10-35 mm long and 5-25 mm wide, with serrate to crenate margins, the upper leaf surface is sparsely sprinkled with stellate hairs, more densely below, and the petiole is 3-20 mm long.
