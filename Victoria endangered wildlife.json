The undersides and sides may appear mottled with light coloured circular scars caused by various types of parasites, including scars from the bite of the 'cookie-cutter' shark ( Isistius brasiliensis) (Aguilar 2002).At sexual maturity, sei whales are approximately 12-16 m long, although they can reach lengths of 17.7 m in males and 21 m in females (Gambell 1985). Adult females are about 0.5-0.6 m longer than males, and sei whales of the Southern Hemisphere are larger than those of the Northern Hemisphere (Horwood 1987). The body of the sei whale is slim, streamlined and laterally compressed in the caudal (hind) region.Sounds of the sei whale consist of a series of short pulses with peak energy in the 1.5-3.5 kHz range (Richardson et al. 1995). During a recent Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (SO-GLOBEC) cruise, acoustic recordings accompanied by photographs and acoustic tracking of a group of sei whales feeding in the Western Antarctic Peninsula provided the first confirmed description of sei whale sounds. Vocalisations included a series of \"growly\" type calls, with tonal calls having abrupt shifts in a much lower dominant frequency (~200-400 Hz) (McDonald & Thiele 2004, pers. comm.).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Sei_whale_mother_and_calf_Christin_Khan_NOAA.jpg","Image Author":"Christin Khan"},{"Scientific Name":"Balaenoptera musculus","Common Name":"Blue Whale","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":36.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=36","Family":"Balaenopteridae","Genus":"Balaenoptera","Species":"musculus","Description":"Both the Antarctic blue whale and pygmy blue whale have common phenotypic traits such as grey skin with mottled patterns, which enables identification of individuals. When submerged, the blue whale appears to be a luminous pale blue or aqua. They have a pronounced 'splashguard' in front of their blowholes, with a single pronounced longitudinal ridge leading forward on the rostrum. Their blow is tall and powerful (approximately 10 m). They have a long, smooth back with a small, variably-shaped dorsal fin set towards the tail (Jefferson et al. 1993). Differences between the two subspecies were first determined by whaling catches in the austral summer feeding season (Attard et al. 2010).Differences between the pygmy blue whale and the Antarctic blue whale include:<ul>\r<li><strong>Morphology</strong>: the Antarctic blue whale is the largest of the two subspecies growing to maximum lengths of over 30 m; in comparison, the pygmy blue whale is recorded growing to 24.1 m (Branch et al. 2009, Attard et al. 2010). Despite this difference, determining subspecies in the field can be difficult (Branch et al. 2009)</li>\r<li><strong>Vocalisations/acoustic calls</strong>: both subspecies produce distinctive acoustic calls that can be used to identify each species as well as provide insight into geographic and seasonal distributions (Stafford et al. 2004, 2011).</li>\r<li><strong>Genetics</strong>: both subspecies are genetically distinct, however diagnostic genetic markers are not available (LeDuc et al. 2007, Attard et al. 2012).

The undersides of the flippers and flukes are also white. The head is asymmetrical in colour and is mostly dark but the right lower jaw is white. Baleen plates are black on the left jaw and white on the right jaw. The body is free of mottling or extensive scarring (Leatherwood & Reeves 1983).The fin whale is the second-largest whale species, after the blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus). Adult whales range between 20 and 27 m long and weigh more than 70 tonnes. As with other baleen whales, female fin whales grow to a larger size than males (Aguilar & Lockyer 1987). The fin whale is very streamlined in appearance, with a distinct ridge along the back behind the dorsal fin. The dorsal fin is set two-thirds of the way along the back, and is up to 60 cm tall, curved and often slopes backwards (Leatherwood & Reeves 1983).Fin whales are more gregarious than other baleen whales, and often occur in groups of 6-10, though single animals and pairs are more common. Aggregations of over 100 whales may be observed on feeding grounds (Watkins et al. 1987).Recordings of regular, pulsed sounds, seemingly of mechanical origin, attracted considerable military interest in the 1950s, and eventually these sounds were conclusively linked to sightings of fin whales (Schevill et al. 1964). Fin whale sounds are mostly 20 Hz or 22 Hz and are short, low-frequency tonal sequences (Nieukirk et al. 2004). Pulsed sounds include a \"rumble\" which is a call of very long duration (about 30 seconds), in the frequency range of 10-30 Hz with extensive frequency and amplitude modulation. The association of these sounds with the reproductive season suggests that they may be used in reproductive displays by males (Watkins et al. 1987).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Finhval_%281%29.jpg/1597px-Finhval_%281%29.jpg","Image Author":"Aqqa Rosing-Asvid"},{"Scientific Name":"Megaptera novaeangliae","Common Name":"Humpback Whale","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":38.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=38","Family":"Balaenopteridae","Genus":"Megaptera","Species":"novaeangliae","Description":"The humpback whale is a moderately large baleen whale. The maximum recorded length is 17.4 m, and females are generally 1.0-1.5 m longer than males (Chittleborough 1965). Southern Hemisphere humpback whales generally have a greater degree of white colouration on their ventral surface compared to darker Northern Hemisphere whales but there is no genetic evidence to support the need for subspecies status (Baker et al. 1990). The humpback whale has distinctive markings on the ventral side and trailing edge of their flukes as well as on their dorsal fins and flanks that are used for individual identification (Katona et al. 1979; Kniest et al. 2010). Their dorsal fin is distinctive from other balaenopterid whales as they have a hump on the leading edge of their dorsal fin.The humpback whale produces a variety of sounds throughout their habitat range. These sounds can be used for foraging, when in distress and in non-mating, social circumstances (Clapham 2000). The most studied vocalisations are songs produced by solitary males. The song frequency ranges from less than 20 Hz to 8 kHz (Payne & McVay 1971; Tyack 1981). A whale can sing for a period of minutes to hours and the song can vary over a range of frequencies with more powerful parts of the song audible over several kilometres underwater (Cato 1991). The exact function of male humpback whale song has yet to be determined but it is believed to be an integral part of male behaviour as a form of sexual display (Tyack 1981). Feeding ground song has only recently been recorded from a Southern Ocean Antarctic feeding area, where song transmission has been hypothesised as a form of cultural transmission between the neighbouring South Pacific populations (Garland et al. 2013).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Humpback_Whale_underwater_shot.jpg","Image Author":null},{"Scientific Name":"Eubalaena australis","Common Name":"Southern Right Whale","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":40.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=40","Family":"Balaenidae","Genus":"Eubalaena","Species":"australis","Description":"The southern right whale\u00cais a\u00calarge baleen whale with a less streamlined shape than balaenopterids like the\u00cahumpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). They grow to a maximum length of 17.5 m and weight of 80 t, with mature females often slightly larger than males (Bannister et al. 1996). The mean length of sexually mature females off the South African coast was calculated as 13.85 m (Best & Ruther 1992) and off Argentina as 13.66 m (Whitehead & Payne 1981). Mature females in Soviet catches from the Southern Ocean averaged 14.34 m (Tormosov et al. 1998). Southern Right Whales are about 5.5 m long and 1000-1500 kg at birth and physical maturity is reached at a length of 16 m (Bannister et al. 1996). Age at physical maturity is unknown (Bannister et al. 1996). The vast majority of southern right whale individuals\u00caare uniformly black in colour, often with a white ventral blaze of varying size and shape centred on the umbilicus. About 2.8 % of adults are mottled dark brown to grey, having been white with varying degrees of black marking at birth (Bannister 1990). A small number of adults (1.4-3.4 %) have white dorsal blazing (Bannister 1990). The pectoral fins are short and paddle like, the flukes are uniform in colour with smooth trailing edges, and there is no dorsal fin. A distinctive feature is the presence of whitish or yellowish callosities on the rostrum, chin and lower jaw. These are formed as roughened patches of keratinised skin and colonised by cyamids (small crustaceans known as 'whale lice') (Cummings 1985a). Callosity patterns are present at birth and persist with minor variation through life, such that individual southern right whales can be identified by the number and configuration of callosities (Payne et al. 1983). They provide the basis for studies relying on an ability to recognise individuals from natural markings over long time frames (Best 1990e; Burnell & Bryden 1997; Payne 1986). The southern right whale head\u00cais large compared to body size and the jaw line strongly arched (Jefferson et al. 1993). Baleen plates number from 205-270 and the baleen is usually, dark, very fine, and long (maximum 2.2 m) in comparison to other species (Cummings 1985a). Blubber thickness has been recorded from Soviet catch data as 14-17 cm for a 10 m whale and 23-24 cm for a 15 m whale (Tormosov et al. 1998).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Southern_right_whale6.jpg","Image Author":"Micha\u2018l CATANZARITI"},{"Scientific Name":"Pseudomys shortridgei","Common Name":"Heath Mouse, Dayang, Heath Rat","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":77.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Mammalia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=77","Family":"Muridae","Genus":"Pseudomys","Species":"shortridgei","Description":"The heath mouse occurs in species-rich and structurally complex heathland and woodland in two disjunct areas in south-west Western Australia and around the southern border of South Australia and Victoria.

They have a black bill, dark red irises, dark grey skin around the eyes, and black to grey-black legs and feet. The sexes generally appear alike, but some females can have a duller colouration that makes them difficult to distinguish from immature males (Higgins & Peter 2002).Juvenile birds can be distinguished from the adults on the basis of their much browner plumage and streaked underbody. Immature birds can be distinguished from the adults when in their first or, less often, in their second plumage by their duller colouration (although immature males can appear similar to dull-coloured adult females) (Higgins & Peter 2002).The Red-lored Whistler is usually seen singly or in twos.

The bird has noticeable breeding, non-breeding and juvenile plumages (Higgins & Davies 1996).<strong>Breeding plumage</strong>When breeding, the head and neck feathers are blackish-brown in the centre, giving a streaked pattern over a whitish background. The cap is dark, supercillum (area above eye) poorly marked and lores (area below eye) are white above with a diffuse area of brown. The chin, throat, belly, vent area and underwing are white; breast and flanks are white with a central band of black at each feather end forming an almost solid black centre to the breast. The flanks and undertail can show heart-shaped black spots. The back is blackish-brown with pale grey tips. Across the scapular feathers, central feathers have large chestnut ovals forming a chestnut band across the wings when folded. Covert feathers over primary wing feathers are grey with dark streaks and whitish fringes. The rump and upper tail coverts are white and sparsely marked with black and the tail is dark grey (Hayman et al. 1986; Higgins & Davies 1996).<strong>Non-breeding plumage</strong>During the non-breeding season, the Great Knot is paler and greyer above and on the breast. The breast is more finely streaked than spotted, flanks become sparsely streaked and the undertail is white. The head and upper parts have clear streaks of blackish-grey; most evident on crown and hindneck. Scapulars, wing coverts and mantle feathers are grey-brown with black-brown shaft streaks and edged in white giving a scalloped appearance (Geering et al. 2007; Hayman et al. 1986; Higgins & Davies 1996).<strong>Juvenile plumage</strong>Juveniles are darker and more brown than non-breeding adults; the mantle and scapulars being darkish brown with narrow whitish-buff fringes, giving a scalloped pattern similar to non-breeding adults.

In breeding plumage, the male has a grey-brown crown and nape with a pale chestnut tinge, and a chestnut hindneck and sides of neck; the rest of the upperparts are pale grey-brown, with rufous edges to the feathers which impart a slightly scaled appearance, white sides of the rump and uppertail-coverts, and the tail has a blackish-brown subterminal band. In flight the upperwings feature blackish flight feathers and primary coverts with a narrow white trailing edge to the innerwing and a prominent white wing-bar; the inner wing coverts are grey brown, concolorous with most of the upperparts. The face has a black band across the upper forehead, and is white on the lower forehead; a black stripe runs back from the bill, widening to form a black mask across the eyes and ear coverts, and joins the narrow black band on the upper forehead. The chin and throat are white, bordered by the chestnut of the sides of the neck; there is a broad chestnut band across the upper breast (concolorous with the sides of the neck), and this sometimes has a narrow dark band on its upper edge; the rest of the underparts are white.

These hind limbs are apparent only as small flaps on either side of the vent. Superficially, these animals resemble snakes, but can be readily distinguished from the latter by the presence of external ear openings, a fleshy undivided tongue and a tail which is longer than the body (Cogger 1992). Striped Legless Lizards can be readily distinguished from other legless lizards by body colouration, body size and head scalation.The Striped Legless Lizard is a pale-grey lizard up to 30 cm in length, with a maximum snout-vent length (SVL) of about 12 cm. Striped Legless Lizards have a long thin body and the tail, when unbroken, is about twice the length of the body. They have a series of stripes on their sides and the sides of their back, becoming diagonal bands on the tail (Cogger 1992; Wilson & Knowles 1988). These stripes are dark-brown or blackish and extend the whole length of the individual from the neck to the tail. Each stripe has individual black-centered scales. However, in some individuals, particularly juveniles, these stripes may be very faint or absent. The head is generally darker than the body, tending to black in juveniles. The underside of Striped Legless Lizards is whitish and they have a blunt snout (Cogger 2000). The sexes of Striped Legless Lizards appear very similar externally. However, adult males may be distinguished by the presence of a small rounded 'spur' under each hind limb flap (M.A. Rauhala 1998, pers. comm.).There is significant variation in the size of Striped Legless Lizards in different populations in Victoria. A study at Dashwood found the modal size class to be 6.0 -6.9 g, while a study at Derrimut Grassland Reserve reported the modal size class to be 3.0 -4.1 g (Coulson 1990; Kutt 1992). The modal size class of Striped Legless Lizards captured at the Keilor Plains site was 6.0 -6.9 g. Some generations (size classes) appeared to be uncommon, suggesting that recruitment may be low in some years (O'Shea 1996). Observations of captive animals suggest that Striped Legless Lizards may skip reproduction when not in prime condition (J. Birkett n.d., pers. comm., cited in O'Shea 1996).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Striped_legless_lizard.jpg/440px-Striped_legless_lizard.jpg","Image Author":"Benjamint444"},{"Scientific Name":"Aprasia parapulchella","Common Name":"Pink-tailed Worm-lizard, Pink-tailed Legless Lizard","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1665.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1665","Family":"Pygopodidae","Genus":"Aprasia","Species":"parapulchella","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Pink-tailed_Worm-lizard_%28Aprasia_parapulchella%29_%289105308465%29.jpg/440px-Pink-tailed_Worm-lizard_%28Aprasia_parapulchella%29_%289105308465%29.jpg","Image Author":"Matt"},{"Scientific Name":"Caretta caretta","Common Name":"Loggerhead Turtle","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1763.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1763","Family":"Cheloniidae","Genus":"Caretta","Species":"caretta","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Loggerhead_sea_turtle.jpg/1600px-Loggerhead_sea_turtle.jpg","Image Author":"Ukanda"},{"Scientific Name":"Chelonia mydas","Common Name":"Green Turtle","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1765.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1765","Family":"Cheloniidae","Genus":"Chelonia","Species":"mydas","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Green_turtle_swimming_over_coral_reefs_in_Kona.jpg/1600px-Green_turtle_swimming_over_coral_reefs_in_Kona.jpg","Image Author":"Brocken Inaglory"},{"Scientific Name":"Eretmochelys imbricata","Common Name":"Hawksbill Turtle","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1766.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Reptilia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1766","Family":"Cheloniidae","Genus":"Eretmochelys","Species":"imbricata","Description":"Hawksbill Turtles have a parrot-like beak.

Growling Grass Frogs vary in colour and pattern but in general are olive to bright emerald green, with irregular gold, brown, black or bronze spotting. Their backs are warty and usually have a pale green mid-dorsal stripe. The eardrum is pronounced. A cream or yellow stripe underlined by a dark brown stripe runs from the nostril, through the eye, above the inner ear and down the sides of the body to the groin as a dorso-lateral fold (Barker & Grigg 1977, Robinson 1993). On their bellies, Growling Grass Frogs are white and coarsely granular. During the breeding season males may become yellow or dark grey/black under the throat. The groin and posterior of the thighs are turquoise blue (DEC NSW 2005).Growling Grass Frogs lack webbing on their fingers but the toes are almost fully webbed. Toe discs are small and approximately equal in width to the digits. These frogs possess small vomerine teeth that are attached to a bone in the roof of the mouth and are situated between the internal openings of the nostrils in the roof of the mouth. These teeth are used for holding prey, which is then swallowed whole (Barker et al. 1995).","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Litoria_raniformisA.JPG/440px-Litoria_raniformisA.JPG","Image Author":null},{"Scientific Name":"Litoria booroolongensis","Common Name":"Booroolong Frog","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":1844.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Amphibia","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=1844","Family":"Hylidae","Genus":"Litoria","Species":"booroolongensis","Description":"The Booroolong Frog is a medium sized tree frog.

Greenhood orchids share other characteristics such as; they grow in the ground; have fleshy tubers which are replaced each year; have a rosette of leaves which they shed each year; and are pollinated by male fungus gnats and mosquitoes (insects of the families Mycetophilidae and Culicidae respectively) (Bishop 1996).The Leafy Greenhood is distinctive amongst the Greenhood orchids because of its large fleshy leaves that are typically in a loose rosette surrounding the stem and large flowers (30 -40 mm long) with bright reddish-brown colourations in the sinus and hood (Jones et al. 1999).Floral StructuresLeafy Greenhoods produce a single, semi-nodding greenhood up to 40 mm long and 12 -15 mm wide (Bramwells 1993). This hood is translucent white with green stripes on top (the dorsal sepal), whilst the sides of the hoods (petals) are a reddish-chocolate brown. The lower part of the flower resembles a fork-like structure due to a deep notch between the chocolate brown lateral sepals (Jones 1998d).Distinctive features of this species' flower include that the hood is erect for &#190; of its length and then curves forward (downward) in a semicircle and ends in a blunt point (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995; Jones et al. 1999) and that the modified petal (labellum) appears as a short brown tongue within the hood (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995). In the related species  P. sp. aff.  cucullata (Barrington Tops) the top of the hood is horizontal and does not curve downward like the Leafy Greenhood, and has a broader, more strongly curved labellum (Bishop 1996).Vegetative CharactersThe Leafy Greenhood has a thick, basal rosette of three to seven fleshy dark green leaves that can appear cabbage-like (Backhouse & Jeanes 1995; Jones et al. 1999). In Tasmania, the leaves have also been recorded growing up the stem (Jones et al. 1999). Plants are deciduous and become dormant during summer (Dell & Bester 2006).Tubers of Leafy Greenhoods from Mornington Peninsula populations can grow up to 19 mm and produce replacement tubers each year, irrespective of whether the plant has produced leaves during that season (Mawson pers comm., as cited in Dell & Bester 2006). Leafy Greenhoods from Mornington Peninsula have shown that there is a relationship between tuber size and re-shooting/flowering time, with larger tubers shooting earlier (Dell & Bester 2006).","Image":"https://data.rbg.vic.gov.au/cip/preview/image/library/124617?maxsize=1024","Image Author":"Jeff Jeanes "},{"Scientific Name":"Brachyscome muelleroides","Common Name":"Mueller Daisy","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":15572.0,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=15572","Family":"Asteraceae","Genus":"Brachyscome","Species":"muelleroides","Description":null,"Image":"https://data.rbg.vic.gov.au/cip/preview/image/library/78866?maxsize=1024","Image Author":"Neville Walsh"},{"Scientific Name":"Caladenia hastata","Common Name":"Melblom's Spider-orchid","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":16118.0,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Liliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=16118","Family":"Orchidaceae","Genus":"Caladenia","Species":"hastata","Description":null,"Image":"https://data.rbg.vic.gov.au/cip/preview/image/library/124665?maxsize=512","Image Author":"Jeff Jeanes "},{"Scientific Name":"Euphrasia collina subsp. muelleri","Common Name":"Purple Eyebright, Mueller's Eyebright","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":16151.0,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=16151","Family":"Scrophulariaceae","Genus":"Euphrasia","Species":"collina","Description":"The Purple Eyebright is a semi-parasitic perennial herb growing up to 41 cm high (Barker 1999).","Image":"https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/ImageHandler.ashx?graphicsId=43363&maxWidth=150","Image Author":"Colin Totterhall"},{"Scientific Name":"Ballantinia antipoda","Common Name":"Southern Shepherd's Purse","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":16173.0,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=16173","Family":"Brassicaceae","Genus":"Ballantinia","Species":"antipoda","Description":"The Southern Shepherd's Purse is a small annual plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family.

The upperwings are mostly blue-black, with a prominent yellow shoulder-patch and red feathers on the inner secondary coverts and tertials; in flight, the red secondary coverts appear as a red band. The underbody is bright yellow except for the undertail, which is black. The underwings are bright yellow, contrasting with blackish flight feathers. The female has a similar pattern of plumage to the male, but appears duller: the head, neck and underparts are dull olive-green instead of bright yellow; the tail and flight feathers are dull bluish-green instead of blue-black; the shoulder-patch is duller greenish yellow; and the red markings on the wings are duller; and the underwings appear lime green instead of bright yellow (Higgins 1999).The Regent Parrot is usually seen in pairs or small flocks, but much larger flocks may congregate around abundant sources of food (Bedggood 1958; Morgan 1917; Sullivan 1967). During breeding season, when females are busy incubating the eggs, males may form single-sex flocks (Beardsell 1985; Keartland 1903; Tarr 1964).

The inflorescences are delicate, open, up to 25 cm in length and remain partly enclosed by the upper leaf sheath until late maturity, often drying to a pale golden colour. Panicles (the separate branched cluster of flowers that form the flowerhead) detach from the plant when mature and are blown away by wind. The light green, or occasionally purple-tinged, spikelets (small spikes that form the 'flower') are 2.5 mm (Vic DPI 2011) to 4 mm in length (Murphy 2010), with the upper glume (modified leaf or scale at base of a grass spikelet) longer than the lower glume. Lemmas (outer or lower modified leaves or scales) have fine, straight, or gently curved, awns (bristle-like appendages found on the spikelets) that are 1.5-3 mm in length and are attached towards the top, being only just visible beyond the tip of the spikelet (Murphy 2010; Vic. DPI 2011).Environmental conditions and site characteristics determine the species' habit, with plants at drier sites generally smaller and with fewer inflorescences than those at moister sites. In ephemeral (not lasting) habitat, the species is an annual (dies off each year), whilst in continuous moist sites the species is perennial (lasting for many years) (Murphy 2010).","Image":"http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vroimages.nsf/Images/sip_adamsons_blown_grass/$File/adamsons_blown_grass_plants.jpg","Image Author":"A J Brown"},{"Scientific Name":"Leiocarpa gatesii","Common Name":"Wrinkled Buttons","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":76212.0,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=76212","Family":"Asteraceae","Genus":"Leiocarpa","Species":"gatesii","Description":"Short-lived perennial, 10\u00d020 cm high; stems branched at or near base, ascending, white-cottony.

Striatellum (G.W.Carr 10345)","Description":"Omeo Storksbill Pelargonium sp. (G.W. Carr 10345), syn. P. striatellum, is a tufted perennial forb with leaves in basal rosettes arising from fleshy, often extensively branched rhizomes. Plants occur in clonal colonies that may be up to several metres wide. The leaf-stalks are velvety, having short glandular and non-glandular hairs in roughly equal proportions, and with occasional longer non-glandular hairs. The leaves are all or mostly basal (in a rosette), with leaves on the short stems, if present, being opposite. The rosette leaves are on leaf-stalks between 2 and 6 cm long, with leaf blades egg-shaped in outline, between 1 and 2.5 cm long and 1 to 2 cm wide. The leaves are entire or shallowly lobed; most commonly with 5 to 7 lobes and with scalloped margins. The leaf surface is minutely furry along the veins and near the edges. The flowering stems are to 15 cm tall, and terminate with an umbrella-like flower-cluster with 1 to 3 (and sometimes to 7) flowers that are borne on stalks between 1 and 2 cm long. The flowers have 5 petals that are wider at their tips than at their bases and are between 8 and 11 mm long. The flowers are in various shades of pale pink and each petal is marked with darker crimson or purple branching stripes that run down to the center of the flower. Flowers have 10 stamens. The fruit, 10 to 15 mm long, is a dry structure that splits into 5 segments. The fruit is elongated and shaped like a stork's bill, hence the plant's common name. Flowering is from October to March, with the peak flowering occurring in November and December. Seeds ripen and are shed about five weeks after flowering.","Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Pelargonium_benambra.jpg/220px-Pelargonium_benambra.jpg","Image Author":"Melburnian"},{"Scientific Name":"Galaxias rostratus","Common Name":"Flathead Galaxias, Beaked Minnow, Flat-headed Galaxias, Flat-headed Jollytail, Flat-headed Minnow","Threatened status":"Critically Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":84745.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Actinopterygii","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=84745","Family":"Galaxiidae","Genus":"Galaxias","Species":"rostratus","Description":null,"Image":"https://fishesofaustralia.net.au/images/image/Galaxias%20rostratus%20Tarmo%20Raadik%20alt.jpg","Image Author":"Tarmo Raadik"},{"Scientific Name":"Limosa lapponica baueri","Common Name":"Bar-tailed Godwit (baueri), Western Alaskan Bar-tailed Godwit","Threatened status":"Vulnerable","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":86380.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Aves","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=86380","Family":"Scolopacidae","Genus":"Limosa","Species":"lapponica","Description":null,"Image":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f5/Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg/220px-Limosa_lapponica_2_-_Taren_Point.jpg","Image Author":"JJ Harrison"},{"Scientific Name":"Limosa lapponica menzbieri","Common Name":"Northern Siberian Bar-tailed Godwit, Bar-tailed Godwit (menzbieri)","Threatened status":"Critically Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":86432.0,"Kingdom":"Animalia","Class":"Aves","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=86432","Family":"Scolopacidae","Genus":"Limosa","Species":"lapponica","Description":null,"Image":null,"Image Author":null},{"Scientific Name":"Commersonia prostrata","Common Name":"Dwarf Kerrawang","Threatened status":"Endangered","Listed SPRAT TaxonID":87152.0,"Kingdom":"Plantae","Class":"Magnoliopsida","Profile":"http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=87152","Family":"Malvaceae","Genus":"Commersonia","Species":"prostrata","Description":"The Dwarf Kerrawang is a prostrate, mat-forming shrub with trailing branches to 2 m long and ovate to cordate leaves 10-35 mm long and 5-25 mm wide, with serrate to crenate margins, the upper leaf surface is sparsely sprinkled with stellate hairs, more densely below, and the petiole is 3-20 mm long.
