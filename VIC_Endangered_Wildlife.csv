Balaenoptera borealis,Sei Whale,Vulnerable,34,Animalia,Mammalia,http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=34,Balaenopteridae,Balaenoptera,borealis,"Sei whales are dark grey or blue-grey on their back and sides. The undersides and sides may appear mottled with light coloured circular scars caused by various types of parasites, including scars from the bite of the 'cookie-cutter' shark (<i>Isistius brasiliensis</i>) (Aguilar 2002).At sexual maturity, sei whales are approximately 12&ndash;16 m long, although they can reach lengths of 17.7 m in males and 21 m in females (Gambell 1985). Adult females are about 0.5&ndash;0.6 m longer than males, and sei whales of the Southern Hemisphere are larger than those of the Northern Hemisphere (Horwood 1987). The body of the sei whale is slim, streamlined and laterally compressed in the caudal (hind) region.Sounds of the sei whale consist of a series of short pulses with peak energy in the 1.5&ndash;3.5 kHz range (Richardson et al. 1995). During a recent Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (SO-GLOBEC) cruise, acoustic recordings accompanied by photographs and acoustic tracking of a group of sei whales feeding in the Western Antarctic Peninsula provided the first confirmed description of sei whale sounds. Vocalisations included a series of ""growly"" type calls, with tonal calls having abrupt shifts in a much lower dominant frequency (~200&ndash;400 Hz) (McDonald &amp;&nbsp;Thiele 2004, pers. comm.).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sei_whale#/media/File:Sei_whale_mother_and_calf_Christin_Khan_NOAA.jpg
Balaenoptera musculus,Blue Whale,Endangered,36,Animalia,Mammalia,http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=36,Balaenopteridae,Balaenoptera,musculus,"Both the Antarctic blue whale and pygmy blue whale have common phenotypic traits such as grey skin with mottled patterns, which enables identification of individuals. When submerged, the blue whale appears to be a luminous pale blue or aqua. They have a pronounced 'splashguard' in front of their blowholes, with a single pronounced longitudinal ridge leading forward on the rostrum. Their blow is tall and powerful (approximately 10 m). They have a long, smooth back with a small, variably-shaped dorsal fin set towards the tail (Jefferson et al. 1993). Differences between the two subspecies were first determined by whaling catches in the austral summer feeding season (Attard et al. 2010).Differences between the&nbsp;pygmy blue whale and the Antarctic blue whale include:<ul><li><strong>Morphology</strong>: the Antarctic blue whale&nbsp;is the largest of the two subspecies growing to maximum lengths of over 30 m; in comparison, the pygmy blue whale is recorded growing&nbsp;to 24.1 m (Branch et al. 2009, Attard et al. 2010). Despite this difference, determining&nbsp;subspecies in the field can be difficult (Branch et al. 2009)</li><li><strong>Vocalisations/acoustic calls</strong>: both subspecies produce distinctive acoustic calls that can be used to identify each species as well as provide insight into geographic and seasonal distributions (Stafford et al. 2004,&nbsp;2011).</li><li><strong>Genetics</strong>: both subspecies are genetically distinct, however diagnostic genetic markers are not available (LeDuc et al. 2007, Attard et al. 2012). The Antarctic and pygmy blue whale have been known to hybridise (Attard et al. 2012).</li><li><strong>Austral summer distribution</strong>: the pygmy blue whale is typically found in more northern areas (north of 54&deg; S) at lower latitudes, throughout the Indian Ocean, whereas the Antarctic blue whale is usually found further south of Australia (60&deg; S), circumpolar wide (Branch et al. 2009, Attard et al. 2010).</li></ul>Blue whale&nbsp;and&nbsp;fin whale hybrids&nbsp;has been documented in five cases (B&eacute;rub&eacute; &amp; Aguilar 1998; Cipriano &amp; Palumbi 1999; Spilliaert et al. 1991). The hybrids - three females and two males - were taken in commercial whaling operations in the Northern Hemisphere.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Anim1754_-_Flickr_-_NOAA_Photo_Library.jpg
Balaenoptera physalus,Fin Whale,Vulnerable,37,Animalia,Mammalia,http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=37,Balaenopteridae,Balaenoptera,physalus,"Fin whales are dark grey to brownish black dorsally, grading to pale or white along the abdomen. The undersides of the flippers and flukes are also white. The head is asymmetrical in colour and is mostly dark but the right lower jaw is white. Baleen plates are black on the left jaw and white on the right jaw. The body is free of mottling or extensive scarring (Leatherwood &amp; Reeves 1983).The fin whale is the second-largest whale species, after the blue whale (<i>Balaenoptera musculus</i>). Adult whales range between 20 and 27 m long and weigh more than 70 tonnes. As with other baleen whales, female fin whales grow to a larger size than males (Aguilar &amp; Lockyer 1987). The fin whale is very streamlined in appearance, with a distinct ridge along the back behind the dorsal fin. The dorsal fin is set two-thirds of the way along the back, and is up to 60 cm tall, curved and often slopes backwards (Leatherwood &amp; Reeves 1983).Fin whales are more gregarious than other baleen whales, and often occur in groups of 6&ndash;10, though single animals and pairs are more common. Aggregations of over 100 whales may be observed on feeding grounds (Watkins et al. 1987).Recordings of regular, pulsed sounds, seemingly of mechanical origin, attracted considerable military interest in the 1950s, and eventually these sounds were conclusively linked to sightings of fin whales (Schevill et al. 1964). Fin whale sounds are mostly 20 Hz or 22 Hz and are short, low-frequency tonal sequences (Nieukirk et al. 2004). Pulsed sounds include a ""rumble"" which is a call of very long duration (about 30 seconds), in the frequency range of 10&ndash;30 Hz with extensive frequency and amplitude modulation. The association of these sounds with the reproductive season suggests that they may be used in reproductive displays by males (Watkins et al. 1987).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Finhval_(1).jpg
Megaptera novaeangliae,Humpback Whale,Vulnerable,38,Animalia,Mammalia,http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=38,Balaenopteridae,Megaptera,novaeangliae,"The humpback whale is a moderately large baleen whale. The maximum recorded length is 17.4 m, and females are generally 1.0&ndash;1.5 m longer than males (Chittleborough 1965). Southern Hemisphere humpback whales generally have a greater degree of white colouration on their ventral surface compared to darker Northern Hemisphere whales but there is no genetic evidence to support the need for subspecies status (Baker et al. 1990). The humpback whale has distinctive markings on the ventral side and trailing edge of their flukes as well as on their dorsal fins and flanks that are used for individual identification (Katona et al. 1979; Kniest et al. 2010). Their dorsal fin is distinctive from other balaenopterid whales as they have a hump on the leading edge of their dorsal fin.The humpback whale produces a variety of sounds throughout their habitat range. These sounds can be used for foraging, when in distress and in non-mating, social circumstances (Clapham 2000). The most studied vocalisations are songs produced by solitary males. The song frequency ranges from less than 20 Hz to 8 kHz (Payne &amp; McVay 1971; Tyack 1981). A whale can sing for a period of minutes to hours and the song can vary over a range of frequencies with more powerful parts of the song audible over several kilometres underwater (Cato 1991). The exact function of male humpback whale song has yet to be determined but it is believed to be an integral part of male behaviour as a form of sexual display (Tyack 1981). Feeding ground song has only recently been recorded from a Southern Ocean Antarctic feeding area, where song transmission has been hypothesised as a form of cultural transmission between the neighbouring South Pacific populations (Garland et al. 2013).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Humpback_Whale_underwater_shot.jpg
Eubalaena australis,Southern Right Whale,Endangered,40,Animalia,Mammalia,http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/sprat/public/publicspecies.pl?taxon_id=40,Balaenidae,Eubalaena,australis,"The southern right whale is a large baleen whale with a less streamlined shape than balaenopterids like the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). They grow to a maximum length of 17.5 m and weight of 80 t, with mature females often slightly larger than males (Bannister et al. 1996). The mean length of sexually mature females off the South African coast was calculated as 13.85 m (Best & Ruther 1992) and off Argentina as 13.66 m (Whitehead & Payne 1981). Mature females in Soviet catches from the Southern Ocean averaged 14.34 m (Tormosov et al. 1998). Southern Right Whales are about 5.5 m long and 1000-1500 kg at birth and physical maturity is reached at a length of 16 m (Bannister et al. 1996). Age at physical maturity is unknown (Bannister et al. 1996). The vast majority of southern right whale individuals are uniformly black in colour, often with a white ventral blaze of varying size and shape centred on the umbilicus. About 2.8 % of adults are mottled dark brown to grey, having been white with varying degrees of black marking at birth (Bannister 1990). A small number of adults (1.4-3.4 %) have white dorsal blazing (Bannister 1990). The pectoral fins are short and paddle like, the flukes are uniform in colour with smooth trailing edges, and there is no dorsal fin. A distinctive feature is the presence of whitish or yellowish callosities on the rostrum, chin and lower jaw. These are formed as roughened patches of keratinised skin and colonised by cyamids (small crustaceans known as 'whale lice') (Cummings 1985a). Callosity patterns are present at birth and persist with minor variation through life, such that individual southern right whales can be identified by the number and configuration of callosities (Payne et al. 1983). They provide the basis for studies relying on an ability to recognise individuals from natural markings over long time frames (Best 1990e; Burnell & Bryden 1997; Payne 1986). The southern right whale head is large compared to body size and the jaw line strongly arched (Jefferson et al. 1993). Baleen plates number from 205-270 and the baleen is usually, dark, very fine, and long (maximum 2.2 m) in comparison to other species (Cummings 1985a). Blubber thickness has been recorded from Soviet catch data as 14-17 cm for a 10 m whale and 23-24 cm for a 15 m whale (Tormosov et al. 1998).",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_right_whale#/media/File:Southern_right_whale6.jpg

Although smaller than a rabbit, the White-footed Rabbit-rat's colour and large, broad ears gave it a superficial resemblance to the rabbit. As all specimens were collected during the first half of the 19th century, most descriptions of the animal come from the work of Gould (1863), who worked in Australia in the 1840s. Gould described this species as having long, soft fur which was grey with ashy-brown tips. The back of the animal had many fine black hairs that were intermixed with these brown tips. The whiskers were black and there was a narrow black line around the eye. The underside of the animal, the inner surface of the limbs and the feet were white.

The eyebrow is pale and the chin and throat are white. The breast is chestnut and merges into the hindneck and the sides of the neck. It is demarcated from the throat by a narrow black band, with a narrow black line which extends down from the mask. The rest of the underbody is white. The upperwings are generally grey-brown, though in flight the primary coverts and flight feathers are blackish, with thin white trailing edges on the secondaries and there is a prominent but narrow white wing-bar. The underwing is white with a narrow dusky trailing edge.

As with other members of the legless lizard family, Striped Legless Lizards lack forelimbs and have only very reduced hind limbs. These hind limbs are apparent only as small flaps on either side of the vent. Superficially, these animals resemble snakes, but can be readily distinguished from the latter by the presence of external ear openings, a fleshy undivided tongue and a tail which is longer than the body (Cogger 1992). Striped Legless Lizards can be readily distinguished from other legless lizards by body colouration, body size and head scalation.The Striped Legless Lizard is a pale-grey lizard up to 30 cm in length, with a maximum snout-vent length (SVL) of about 12 cm. Striped Legless Lizards have a long thin body and the tail, when unbroken, is about twice the length of the body. They have a series of stripes on their sides and the sides of their back, becoming diagonal bands on the tail (Cogger 1992; Wilson &#38; Knowles 1988). These stripes are dark-brown or blackish and extend the whole length of the individual from the neck to the tail. Each stripe has individual black-centered scales. However, in some individuals, particularly juveniles, these stripes may be very faint or absent. The head is generally darker than the body, tending to black in juveniles. The underside of Striped Legless Lizards is whitish and they have a blunt snout (Cogger 2000). The sexes of Striped Legless Lizards appear very similar externally. However, adult males may be distinguished by the presence of a small rounded 'spur' under each hind limb flap (M.A. Rauhala 1998, pers. comm.).There is significant variation in the size of Striped Legless Lizards in different populations in Victoria. A study at Dashwood found the modal size class to be 6.0&#150;6.9 g, while a study at Derrimut Grassland Reserve reported the modal size class to be 3.0&#150;4.1 g (Coulson 1990; Kutt 1992). The modal size class of Striped Legless Lizards captured at the Keilor Plains site was 6.0&#150;6.9 g. Some generations (size classes) appeared to be uncommon, suggesting that recruitment may be low in some years (O'Shea 1996). Observations of captive animals suggest that Striped Legless Lizards may skip reproduction when not in prime condition (J. Birkett n.d., pers. comm., cited in O'Shea 1996).",

Growling Grass Frogs vary in colour and pattern but in general are olive to bright emerald green, with irregular gold, brown, black or bronze spotting. Their backs are warty and usually have a pale green mid-dorsal stripe. The eardrum is pronounced. A cream or yellow stripe underlined by a dark brown stripe runs from the nostril, through the eye, above the inner ear and down the sides of the body to the groin as a dorso-lateral fold (Barker &amp; Grigg 1977, Robinson 1993).

The groin and posterior of the thighs are turquoise blue (DEC NSW 2005).Growling Grass Frogs lack webbing on their fingers but the toes are almost fully webbed. Toe discs are small and approximately equal in width to the digits. These frogs possess small vomerine teeth that are attached to a bone in the roof of the mouth and are situated between the internal openings of the nostrils in the roof of the mouth. These teeth are used for holding prey, which is then swallowed whole (Barker et al. 1995).",

In the related species <i>P. </i>sp. aff.<i> cucullata </i>(Barrington Tops) the top of the hood is horizontal and does not curve downward like the Leafy Greenhood, and has a broader, more strongly curved labellum (Bishop 1996).<b>Vegetative Characters</b><br />The Leafy Greenhood has a thick, basal rosette of three to seven fleshy dark green leaves that can appear cabbage-like (Backhouse &#38; Jeanes 1995; Jones et al. 1999). In Tasmania, the leaves have also been recorded growing up the stem (Jones et al. 1999). Plants are deciduous and become dormant during summer (Dell &#38; Bester 2006).Tubers of Leafy Greenhoods from Mornington Peninsula populations can grow up to 19 mm and produce replacement tubers each year, irrespective of whether the plant has produced leaves during that season (Mawson pers comm., as cited in Dell &#38; Bester 2006). Leafy Greenhoods from Mornington Peninsula have shown that there is a relationship between tuber size and re-shooting/flowering time, with larger tubers shooting earlier (Dell &#38; Bester 2006).",

The leaves are sometimes absent at the flowering stage (Backhouse &amp; Jeanes 1995).There are 2&ndash;6 flowers, up to 2 cm long, on short, stout flower-stalks. The flowers are translucent white with green stripes and suffusions. The narrow fleshy labellum (or lip), up to 7 mm long, has several pairs of long marginal hairs and a smooth basal mound (Backhouse &amp; Jeanes 1995). The dorsal sepal and lateral petals curve inwards to form a hood. The fruit are a capsule (Leigh et al. 1984).",

They have&nbsp;colourless transverse lines alternating with rows of colorless dots and small scales covering the skin. There are two dorsal fins, the first dorsal fin is yellow or bluish, the anal fin and the finlets are dusky yellow edged with black. Keels are present near the tail and are coloured yellow in adults (Carpenter &amp; Niem 2001).Southern Bluefin Tuna can grow to 225 cm in length and 200 kg in weight. However, adults are more commonly recorded at around 160 cm (Carpenter &amp; Niem 2001; Phillips et al. 2009). Length-weight correlations are variable in adult fish, depending on physiological conditions (Collette &amp; Nauen 1983). Juveniles recruit to the aggregations of adults&nbsp;at lengths around 55 cm and weighing around 3.5 kg (Phillips et al. 2009).",

The inflorescences are&nbsp;delicate, open, up to 25 cm in length and remain partly enclosed by the upper leaf sheath until late maturity, often drying to a pale golden colour. Panicles (the separate branched cluster of flowers that form the flowerhead) detach from the plant when mature and are blown away by wind. The light green, or occasionally purple-tinged, spikelets (small spikes that form the 'flower') are 2.5 mm (Vic DPI 2011) to 4 mm in length (Murphy 2010), with the upper glume (modified leaf or scale at base of a grass spikelet) longer than the lower glume. Lemmas (outer or lower modified leaves or scales) have fine, straight, or gently curved, awns (bristle-like appendages found on the spikelets) that are 1.5&ndash;3 mm in length and are attached towards the top, being only just visible beyond the tip of the spikelet (Murphy 2010; Vic. DPI 2011).Environmental conditions and site characteristics determine the species' habit, with plants at drier sites generally smaller and with fewer inflorescences than those at moister sites. In ephemeral (not lasting) habitat, the species is an annual (dies off each year), whilst in continuous moist sites the species is perennial (lasting for many years) (Murphy 2010).",
